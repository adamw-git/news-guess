    "body": "The Australian defence force says it has “no place” for rightwing extremists, despite one of its members remaining in the service for more than eight months after police found he had been involved in a gathering of the National Socialist Network, a neo-Nazi group.\nSeparately, the 25-year-old Sydney man was charged in August with possessing alleged violent extremist and child abuse material on his mobile phones after being arrested in Holsworthy. He will face court again next month.\nThe Australian federal police charged the man after it received intelligence that he attended an NSN gathering in Marsfield, in Sydney’s north, in late 2024.\nFootage of the gathering, seen by Guardian Australia, shows about a dozen men clad in black exercise clothing in a public park. It is believed they had been conducting a “training” session.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n“Further inquiries indicated the man may be in possession of the illicit material,” the AFP said in a statement.\n“Search warrants were executed at various locations in February, April and August 2025. Items seized included mobile phones which allegedly contained violent extremist and child abuse material. Forensic review of the devices allegedly revealed the presence of the material, including video artefacts of terrorist attacks and videos depicting minors performing sexual acts.\n“The man is alleged to be a member of several online chat groups where the illicit material was discussed and disseminated.”\nHe has been charged with one count of possessing violent extremist material and one count of possessing child abuse material.\nIt is believed he remains an ADF member, but defence would not confirm this, nor when it became aware he was an associate of the NSN.\n“There is no place within defence for behaviours or associations that are inconsistent with defence values,” an ADF spokesperson said.\n“Defence has a zero tolerance policy for criminal behaviour.”\nAdministration and disciplinary processes can occur in situations where a defence member is charged with or convicted of a civilian offence, as opposed to within the military justice system. The ADF would not comment on whether the man was already subject to such a process.\nThe ADF also did not comment on whether state and federal law enforcement and intelligence bodies shared information with them about members suspected to be involved in groups such as the NSN.\nIn 2021, a new Asio framework was developed to share information with the armed services about potential extremist links.\nThe ADF also declined to comment on whether it monitors employees’ possible involvement with these groups, and how it educates its members about the risk of far-right groups.\nLast year, Guardian Australia revealed there had been at least 16 investigations into defence personnel allegedly engaging with extremism or supremacism since 2022.\nIn October 2021, the ADF tightened its vetting procedures in an attempt to prevent nationalist and racist violent extremists from joining amid concerns former personnel were linked to local white supremacist groups.\nAsio also warned in its annual report that year that “some nationalist and racist violent extremists seek to join the Australian defence force to obtain training and capability.”"

    "body": "In 2012, I moved from the Sunshine Coast to Melbourne to join the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA). There wasn’t a big circus or acrobatics community where I grew up, so it felt exciting to be surrounded by 23 other teenagers who shared the same passion.\nI was 17, the youngest of our year, and my allocated buddy was Cal. He was a year older, full of energy and had a way of making everyone laugh. We clicked instantly, and we took the rules of being a buddy very seriously – including giving each other a muffin if one of us was injured. We both ate a lot of muffins that year.\nWe also balanced each other out. He specialised in teeterboard and balance ladder, and I perform with hula hoops. Cal has a larger-than-life personality, while I am quieter. His brain always seemed to have a million tabs open, whereas mine works quite differently.\nCircus school was very social. On weekends the whole group went to movies or parties, but slowly and subtly Cal and I drifted into spending more time together. We became flirty friends. Even though there was tension between us, we didn’t rush into anything because we knew we’d be working side by side for years and we didn’t want to complicate things.\nIn our second year, our flirty friendship turned into something more. During a study tour in Paris, Cal told me he loved me. It wasn’t under the Eiffel Tower like he’d planned, but it was still very special. After that, we became girlfriend and boyfriend, but it wasn’t long before our schedules were going to change and time together wasn’t guaranteed.\nIn 2015, Cal’s company took him to the UK for a few months. I had my first contract in Germany, and when doing long distance wasn’t sustainable, we decided to end things. It was hard, but it felt like the right choice at the time.\nThe following year, I was given a break from touring and I booked a trip to London to see some Australian friends living there. I knew Cal would be there too, and when we saw each other again, it was like no time had passed at all. He asked if I wanted to give things another go, and I didn’t hesitate.\nThat summer, his company was performing in the circus and theatre section at Glastonbury. I put my hand up to volunteer with the team so I could be there too.\nAdele was the headliner, and I was a fan. But I wasn’t familiar with Make You Feel My Love. When she started singing that song, I started crying. It felt as though the lyrics – “I’ve known it from the moment that we met. No doubt in my mind where you belong” – were speaking directly to us. There was no doubt in my mind that we should be together. After the show, I told Cal how I felt, and we agreed to make it work, no matter the challenges.\nFor the next few years we toured almost constantly, often in different countries, but we made the effort to see each other whenever possible. In 2017 we created a cabaret show so we could finally tour together.\nWhen Covid halted touring, we lived at Cal’s sister’s place in the Blue Mountains, helping with her kids while she worked. It was the first time in years we weren’t travelling, and it gave us a chance to enjoy everyday life together. It was nice to set up a space that was our own, and not live out of a suitcase for a while. When restrictions were lifted, we eventually settled down in Queensland.\nWe’ve since built a shipping container home on my parents’ property, with a sauna, ice bath and Jacuzzi. It feels like a little place we can retreat to between tours. These days, we spend most of the year together.\nOn stage, Cal is always my biggest supporter – I can hear his laugh across the room. When he hears my music cue, he cheers and calls out “that’s my girlfriend”.\nSometimes he’ll surprise me with a muffin, just like when we first met. It reminds me how far we’ve come, and how much we still lift each other up.\nChelsea is performing in Lash Out at the Sydney fringe festival from 23 September to 12 October. Cal is performing in Elixir Revived in Sydney until 12 October\nDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

    "body": "Barry Lyon was a district ranger in Cape York during the 1990s when he, his wife, Shelley, and their mate Steve started to become concerned about a few saltwater crocodiles becoming “a bit cheeky”.\nThe population of the apex predator of Australia’s tropical north had begun to recover after being hunted to near extinction a few decades ago.\n“After the hunting era, crocodiles were really wary,” Lyon says. “But there were a few cheeky ones around.”\nThe three Queenslanders began toying with an idea they hoped might keep both salties and people safe: what if they could instil that wariness back into those cheeky crocs?\nThen Lyon learned that a big male with a distinctive white scar across his belly and jaw was stalking boats in a prized barramundi fishing hole called Old Faithful on the Normanby River in Lakefield national park.\nHe knew Lakefield, now Rinyirru, well – Lyon had been appointed the park’s first ranger back in the late 70s. And he knew he had found a case upon which to test their cheeky croc theory.\nThe park ranger fired a few rounds from a semi-automatic rifle into the water near the distinctive croc. And it worked, the 4.2m croc was spooked. But only for a few months.\nSo Lyon decided it was time to call in the big guns – he rang his mate Steve.\nWhen the man known as “The Crocodile Hunter” answered that call, he brought a documentary crew along with him. The experiment that followed would be documented in Steve Irwin’s legendary 1990s TV series.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nLyon and Irwin trapped the nuisance croc at the Old Faithful waterhole, put him under a tarp for 24 hours and – armed with departmental approval – set about “hazing” him.\nThey shone lights at him, drove boats near him and made their human presence felt during the crocodile’s ordeal. Then they released the croc back into the Normanby.\n“It was a complete success,” Lyon says. “Ever since, he’s been really, really well behaved.”\nIn the three decades that followed, the croc with the big white scar made famous by the khaki-clad conservationist became known by the waterhole he claimed as his own: Old Faithful.\nAll that changed, however, on 8 September, when wildlife officers of the Queensland Environment Department, deciding Old Faithful was no longer a well-behaved boy, trapped and removed him. A smaller croc, between 3m and 3.5m, was also removed.\nA department spokesperson responded to questions regarding Old Faithful with a statement that said: “Public safety is our top priority.”\nThe spokesperson said the department had been monitoring Old Faithful after reports from the public about safety concerns.\n“The crocodile was displaying concerning behaviour and was ultimately removed to ensure public safety,” the statement read. “Habituating crocodiles is detrimental to the animal and dangerous for people.”\nKirstiana Ward, an Environmental Defenders Office lawyer, says her client – the advocacy group Community Representation of Crocodiles (Croc) – informed her that Old Faithful was being held in a government facility in Cairns pending a decision on his future.\nSign up to Breaking News Australia\nGet the most important news as it breaks\nafter newsletter promotion\nUnder Queensland law a creature deemed a “problem crocodile” by the director general of the department can be given over to a crocodile keeper – or euthanised.\nThe department spokesperson did not answer a question as to how many crocodiles removed from the wild were placed in croc farms and how many were killed.\nWard lodged an application on Wednesday with the director general, Patricia O’Callaghan, requesting a statement of reasons for Old Faithful’s removal under judicial review and nature conservation acts, giving O’Callaghan 28 days to respond.\n“We’re asking that no further decisions are made about him … until we’ve received that statement of reasons,” Ward says.\nGiven his size and distinctiveness, Ward says Old Faithful is what is deemed an “icon crocodile” under Queensland law, meaning his fate must be determined in consultation with traditional owners.\nWard says she understands this consultation was taking place while Old Faithful was being held in Cairns. Guardian Australia contacted Riniyirru (Lakefield) Aboriginal Corporation, but they were not in a position to comment by deadline.\nA spokesperson for the Queensland Environment Department said “the decision to remove both crocodiles was made after consultation with traditional owners”.\nWard says she is concerned the big croc will not find an appropriate home – and that, in any case, captivity is no place for Old Faithful.\n“Obviously, that is not a nice end for a majestic, wild crocodile,” she says.\nCroc co-founder and father of the man who hazed Old Faithful in the 90s, Bob Irwin, is among those who disputed his designation by the department.\n“He’s proved over the time that he’s not a problem crocodile – he’s a crocodile that has got his act together,” Irwin Sr says. “Humans have always been in his waterhole, fishing and boating and doing whatever humans do, and he’s never been inclined to be a problem to anybody.”\nLyon warns that the crocodile’s removal might actually make the barramundi fishing spot for which he is named more dangerous for humans.\nHe says it is his belief that it was the smaller crocodile of the two removed whose behaviour had been concerning. Old Faithful, Lyon says, had been keeping that crocodile – and others – at bay.\n“Old Faithful was a dominant croc,” Lyon says. “Now the whole social structure will change. And the thing is, Old Faithful was reliable. People knew that he was gonna be pretty well behaved. Whereas now, a cranky, aggressive croc can move in and take over – then you do have a problem.”\nRemoving Old Faithful, Lyon concludes, was “just really silly”.\n“His place is back in the river,” Lyon says. “That is where he belongs.”"

    "body": "When I first started researching antinatalism a few years ago I presumed its proponents would be losers and edgelords. You know, those men who love playing “devil’s advocate”. Incels masquerading as philosophers and 14-year-olds who have just discovered Nietzsche.\nThe world’s most famous antinatalist academic, David Benatar, has a book called The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys. I remember rolling my eyes back into my skull, thinking: here we go.\nWhy did I start down this red pill rabbit hole?\nWell, I was about to turn 30, and I’m someone who tries to do the right thing. I wanted to know if having a kid, on this burning planet, was the right thing. In 2021 Ipsos released their Perils of Perception: Climate Change paper in which they declared that the single most effective things a person from a rich country (like mine) could do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was: have one less child.\nIt is fair to criticise the very idea of an individual carbon footprint. After all, it was a genius piece of PR propaganda created by BP to shift focus away from the 100 companies who emit 71% of climate-damaging carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. But in Australia, Scott Morrison won the 2019 election after he’d brought a lump of coal into parliament in 2017. I couldn’t see much cause for optimism about systemic change.\nI started looking for a new way to ask that foundational, Socratic question: what is a good life? How can I lead it? And should I try to create it? Is it even possible to?\nWhat I didn’t expect to find in antinatalism was a complex and rich web of ideas, some contradictory and some complementary, but all based on compassion. Most antinatalists I’ve spoken to and whose work I’ve read share the underlying desire to reduce suffering. To minimise harm and hurt. All human life involves suffering, and all humans cause suffering. You may believe that suffering is outweighed by the joys and experiences of life. You may believe that humans are entitled to kill animals to eat or burn the Earth for profit. Those are normal beliefs. But they aren’t universal. There are as many ways to be an antinatalist as there are to be, say, a Christian or a Buddhist or a romantic or a Stoic. But the core belief they share is that for those of us who can choose, the better choice is to not create another human being.\nI was so compelled by these ideas I decided to make the protagonist in my new book, Seed, an antinatalist. What I quickly started learning, when discussing the book and the ideas with people as it developed, was that antinatalism is seriously taboo.\nIt goes against almost every religion to question whether the creation of a new human life is a morally righteous act. It goes against modern economic policy to suggest we should consider anything other than eternal growth of populations and the goods and services they require. It goes against the very real and valid instincts many people have to want, or to have wanted, to have a baby.\nOur society has come a long way in making space for things such as maternal ambivalence and the childfree movement, but those are still frameworks that ask whether or not we want to have children, not whether or not we should.\nI’ve learned that, for many people, these ideas are inherently offensive. It’s one of the reasons I was cautious to make sure the protagonist in my book was a man. Ie: not me. Like all taboo topics, the fast track to shutting down a conversation you don’t want to have is to shame the speaker.\nWhat’s so strange about antinatalism being taboo is that pronatalism is skyrocketing in mainstream prevalence. And whereas antinatalists seek only to convince, pronatalists seek to legislate. People like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and JD Vance want to “make America procreate again”. In late January, a Department of Transportation memo directed the agency to prioritise projects that “give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average”. In April the USAID program cut off their supply of contraceptives to 50 million women, and in July a story came out that they’d ordered a $9.7m supply of birth control to be incinerated.\nFortunately Australians rejected Trumpian rhetoric at the last election. But that doesn’t change the fact I see more compassion from antinatalists than pronatalists right now.\nIn Australia, young people such as Anjali Sharma are having to sue their leaders and elders to try to get the government to acknowledge they have a duty of care not to exacerbate the climate emergency. The government fought the young people and the government won.\nSince May 2022, the federal environment minister has approved 11 new coalmines or expansions with 1,677m tonnes of lifetime emissions. That doesn’t sound like a nation that values new and future lives. Sometimes it feels as though the wrong things are taboo.\n Bri Lee is the author of Seed (AU$34.99, Simon & Schuster)"

    "body": "Dr Jurai Darongkamas has travelled all over the world with her mobility scooter and says she never had a problem until she booked a flight with Qantas earlier this year.\nThe 60-year-old clinical psychologist, who lives in the UK city of Birmingham, flew to Sydney on Thai Airways without issue but was not allowed to board her connecting Qantas flight to her holiday destination in New Zealand.\nAt the heart of Darongkamas’s dispute with Qantas is whether her scooter is a mobility aid, as she argues, or a personal electronic device, as the airline insisted during a six-month long complaints process.\nQantas says it aims to be the “airline of choice for customers with specific needs”, but Darongkamas says Qantas is the only carrier that hasn’t let her fly with her Topmate ES33 scooter and its 281Wh lithium battery.\nShe said the experience on the day “hammered home the fact that I am no longer as able as I was … and people can do what they like” and that the complaint process “just compounded the feeling of powerlessness”.\nDarongkamas wants Australia’s largest airline to apologise for her experience and ensure it doesn’t happen to any other disabled passengers.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nMany airlines have tightened their restrictions on flying with lithium-ion batteries, often found in mobility devices, to try to avoid any possibility of a fire breaking out onboard.\nQantas’s policy says mobility aids are permitted with lithium batteries of up to 300Wh, as long as the batteries can be removed from the devices and taken into the cabin, which Darongkamas says she always does.\nDarongkamas, who is unable to walk for long due to chronic sesamoiditis, argues it shouldn’t be up to Qantas to decide which aid someone with a disability can use.\n“Other ones are too heavy for me. I don’t need to tell [that] to Qantas. It is my choice,” she said.\nBefore Darongkamas and her partner left for their trip, Qantas’s dangerous goods team told them her scooter was classed as a “personal electronic device” according to International Air Transport Association (Iata) regulations.\nIata does not name specific manufacturers in its guidance document for battery-powered mobility aids. It says any lithium batteries must have a UN 38.3 certification, which the Topmate ES33 does. On its website, Topmate says the ES33 battery can be taken on a plane.\nA Topmate spokesperson told Guardian Australia the ES33 “is indeed designed and intended for use as a mobility aid” and that the battery was “certified and safe for air travel when handled in accordance with relevant regulations”.\nAn Iata spokesperson said airlines have to “consider and balance the needs of the passenger traveling with the mobility aid and the safety of the aircraft and its passengers when deciding whether or not it can accept a mobility aid for transport.”\nThe manual Darongkamas provided Qantas as part of her complaint after the incident, seen by the Guardian, describes the ES33 as a “disability scooter”.\nQantas appeared to have cited a different user manual, available online, when it doubled downand told Darongkamas her scooter was “a bike, electric bike, tricycle or electric tricycle” and she couldn’t fly with it.\nHowever, two days later, Qantas’s customer specific needs team emailed asking for the dimensions of “Jurai’s mobility aid” and confirmed the “mobility aid details” had been added to their booking.\nThinking everything was sorted, Darongkamas and her partner left on 31 December. At Sydney airport on 2 January, they were told “at the last minute” they couldn’t get on their flight to New Zealand.\nAfter a night in the airport hotel, Qantas put them on an Air New Zealand flight to Wellington, which Darongkamas says accepted the scooter and battery.\nDisability advocates say they are working with the Australian federal government to implement clear accessibility standards after last year’s release of the aviation whitepaper, which sets out a plan for the sector until 2050.\nThe acting chief executive of People With Disabilities Australia, Megan Spindler-Smith, said inconsistency between different airlines’ rules is a “massive problem”.\nIn February, Qantas told Darongkamas “we sincerely apologise for any lack of clarity” and offered a refund of $616 in February for the two business class seats they had booked on the flight to Wellington. She refused the refund, aiming instead to achieve an outcome that ensured her “horrible experience” would not “happen to future travellers”.\nIn April, Darongkamas escalated her complaint to the industry-funded Airline Customer Advocate (ACA), with no success.\nThe Albanese government has promised to replace the ACA with an independent aviation ombudsman from next year.\nIn July, before it closed Darongkamas’s case, Qantas apologised for giving her conflicting advice but said the information availablestill did not satisfy that the ES33 had been “manufactured as a mobility aid” to the required safety standards.\nQantas said even though it “repeatedly liaised” with Topmate in China the manufacturer was unable to supply the required information about the battery’s test standards. Guardian Australia put this claim to Topmate, but the company did not directly respond to the question.\n“We understand this would have been a disappointing experience for Ms Darongkamas and acknowledge that our communication with her during the process may have been confusing,” a Qantas spokesperson said.\nQantas said it has improved the communication between its dangerous goods and specific needs team.\nSpeaking generally, Erin Turner Manners, a senior solicitor at the Justice and Equity Centre, said airlines have obligations under discrimination and consumer law but this hasn’t prevented discrimination and poor customer experiences.\nShe said airlines should be investing in making their services accessible and that people with disability shouldn’t have to “take on big corporations like airlines and airports” to get a fair outcome."

    "body": "Zimbabwean writer NoViolet Bulawayo has won the Best of Caine award, an honorary prize celebrating a story from past winners of the Caine Prize for African Writing, to mark its 25th anniversary. The prize was given for a short story praised by judges for its “powerful language, distinctive tone of voice, and bold, compelling storytelling”.\nHitting Budapest, which won the 2011 Caine prize, follows a group of six children who sneak from their shantytown, Paradise, into an affluent neighbourhood, Budapest, to steal guavas. First published in the Boston Review, it examines poverty, social and economic inequalities, and the dreams of children.\n“Budapest is like a different country. A country where people who are not like us live,” says the narrator, a nine-year-old girl called Darling. “Budapest is big, big houses with the graveled yards and tall fences and durawalls and flowers and green trees, heavy with fruit that’s waiting for us since nobody around here seems to know what fruit is for. It’s the fruit that gives us courage, otherwise we wouldn’t dare be here.”\nSpeaking after receiving the award at the inaugural Words Across Waters: Afro Lit Fest at the British Library in London today, Bulawayo said winning the Best of Caine award 14 years after her Caine prize success “feels like a moment to reflect on the journey”.\n“Winning the Caine prize as an unpublished writer back in 2011 was truly the kind of defining highlight to jumpstart a career,” she said. “It brought my work to a global audience, affirmed my literary path, and strengthened my confidence and commitment to writing, so that finishing a first novel worthy of the recognition bestowed on me by Africa’s most prestigious literary award – my first ever recognition – was non-negotiable.”\nBulawayo was announced as the winner by Ellah Wakatama, the chair of the Caine prize.\nThe judging panel for the Best of Caine award was headed by author and Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah, and featured novelist and short story writer Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi and film producer Tony Tagoe.\nBulawayo was born and raised in Zimbabwe and moved to the US when she was 18.\nHitting Budapest came about as she was working on a book, and it served as the first chapter of her critically acclaimed debut novel, We Need New Names, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2013 – a first for a Black African woman – and the Guardian First Book award.\nHer second novel, Glory, a satire about the fall of an oppressive regime inspired by the coup against Robert Mugabe, was shortlisted for the 2022 Booker prize.\nSign up to Bookmarks\nDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It is named after Sir Michael Caine, a longtime chairperson of the Booker prize management committee.\nSince it was founded in 2000, the annual prize has recognised 25 winners from 10 different countries. Other past recipients include Kenyan Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor, Nigerian Helon Habila and South African Nadia Davids."

    "body": "Elijah* tried to keep out of trouble when he got out of lock up. A new path seemed within reach but he was torn. “It was so mixed feelings,” he recalls. “I wanted to change my life but I had a bunch of stuff on me … it was like two things fighting at once.”\nWithin weeks, the teenager, who had previously been swept up in burglaries, had joined one of Melbourne’s youth gangs. Things escalated from there.\nThe stabbing deaths of 15-year-old Dau Akueng and 12-year-old Chol Achiek in Melbourne’s west earlier this month have fuelled debate about knife crime and youth offending in Victoria.\nYouth crime is nothing new, but people working with young offenders in the state say the nature of offending has changed. Crime prevention programs say they are frequently referred children whose offences include carjacking, aggravated burglaries and carrying weapons.\nChildren comprised 1,128 of the 5,400 serial repeat offenders responsible for 40% of crime in Victoria last financial year, police said this week. The youth offenders were arrested a combined 7,118 times.\nVictoria police have charged eight teenagers with murder over the deaths of Dau and Chol.\nElijah, 17, credits enrolling in an alternative education school for students who have disengaged from mainstream education for helping him choose a different path.\n“If it wasn’t for the school, then I probably would be locked up again or dead,” he says.\n“This school is gangster. They look after you, they feed you. They actually check on you.”\nIf he comes to school feeling sad, Elijah says his teachers know what to do: “They’ll just leave me alone or I can sit on the bean bag and listen to music,” he says.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n“There’s no point of being disrespectful. If they’re looking after you, feeding you, treating you with respect, there’s no bad in the school.”\nAlong with attending this school, which supported him through numerous stints in custody over the past few years, Elijah says he has increasingly turned to his Christian faith. Recently, he stopped carrying weapons.\n“Even though I want to carry a sword, or I want to … do a lot of things, I don’t do it,” he says.\n“I started relying more on Jesus. It took away … a lot of pressure on myself and it made me feel … just happy in general.”\nHe used to always carry a sword or knife – whatever he could fit in his pants. Sometimes he would even carry a weapon to church. It was often a safety measure, he says, because other people “hated” him.\n“I’m not gonna … sit down and watch people come to me with a knife.”\nVictoria has banned machetes but frontline workers in crime prevention programs say young people repeatedly tell them they carry weapons because they are scared or feel as if they have no other choice.\nElijah’s classmate, Kenji* says he has also carried weapons for protection.\nAfter the deaths of Dau Akueng and Chol Achiek he fears for his safety.\n“I feel like it could happen to me as well,” he says.\n“Because it’s happening to a lot of people out there, innocent people as well,” he says.\nWhen his mother saw a video about what happened to Chol she was “crying even though she didn’t even know who he was”.\nHaving finished a diversion order for numerous violent offences, which involved attending meetings including with a youth worker and mental health service, and not offending for 12 months, Elijah is about to begin a pre-apprenticeship.\nHe says disputes between young boys can begin as a petty rift, often over girls, that then spiral into violence.\n“It’s even for the fame … people don’t do it to get rich and then spoil their families. People do it to get rich and then … get girls,” he says.\nKenji says conflict between groups can start online.\n“Talking to someone over the internet … it just causes problems. It could be the root of some problems with gangs,” he says. “A lot of people die over online stuff.”\nSign up to Breaking News Australia\nGet the most important news as it breaks\nafter newsletter promotion\nYouth Support and Advocacy Services crime prevention manager Navin Dhillon says his organisation’s early intervention crime programs are increasingly seeing referrals for more complex alleged offending and for children as young as 12.\nDhillon is hopeful of turning children’s lives around because the advocacy service is often the first one to work with these young people.\n“We’re able to get in quite efficiently and quite effectively to try and divert them,” he says.\nVictoria’s children’s commissioner, Meena Singh, says it can be difficult for people to understand that some young offenders – increasingly pilloried as emblematic of a crisis in the state – were themselves victims of violence.\nConflicts between gangs are at the heart of some of the violence. A bail decision published in June for a 17-year-old charged with an alleged murder of an 18-year-old involving machetes, is one example.\nPolice allege that over the space of seven weeks the conflict between two gangs led to the father of the accused being held at gunpoint during a home invasion, a non-fatal beating and stabbing with a machete, and the release of a rap music video in which the victim’s gang taunted their rivals.\nPolice believe the alleged murder was retribution for the music video.\nPat Boyle, a former Victoria Police detective superintendent who left the force in 2022, says he has tried many times to change the approach to youth gangs, and the state’s failure to do so means the problem has become far worse than he could have imagined.\nBoyle researched the state’s youth gangs as part of a Churchill Fellowship, which included speaking with police in Europe and North America. He found that including health, education and social service providers in solutions was vital to driving down crime.\nHe says Scottish authorities, for example, looked closely at the foster homes youth offenders had been sent to and found that some children were preyed upon by neighbouring crooks or pedophiles, speeding up the cycle of reoffending.\nThe Victoria police youth gang strategy for 2023-26 says gang members, motivated by status, commit violent crimes, such as robberies and assaults.\nIn Victoria, the state’s most vulnerable children in child protection and who have contact with the youth justice system – often referred to as “crossover kids” – are at a greater risk of being charged with offences, Sentencing Council research has found.\nSingh says young people involved in the child protection system are over represented as victims of youth violence and as youth offenders.\nSingh says children in care are “so misunderstood”.\n“The circumstances of those kids’ lives have led to the government saying ‘we can be a better parent’, but what’s happened after that is an overrepresentation in criminal offending,” she says.\nVictoria’s Commission for Children and Young People is working on an inquiry into the experiences of people who were aged between 10 and 13 when they first came in contact with the criminal justice system.\n Singh says the initial findings were not surprising, reiterating that discussions about how to reduce youth crime too often failed to hear from the young people involved in criminal offending.\n“We just need to get the basics right for young people: safety at home, responding to their health needs, mental and physical, supporting their education needs,” she says.\nElijah has his eyes set on his pre-apprenticeship and leaving behind the violent offending he says he grew up with.\nHe remains friends with the boys in the gang he joined after his release from youth detention. Having spent time homeless together, these boys are bonded by a brotherhood.\n“We’ve made money together. I starved with them. We’ve ate together. I can’t let go. I wouldn’t.”\n*Names have been changed"

    "body": "Julia Schell A few good runs that put her team on the front foot in behind the England defence. Spent a lot of time defending. 6\nAlysha Corrigan Carried the ball plenty but turned possession over a couple of times. An individual representation of Canada’s whole performance. 6\nFlorence Symonds Handled by Meg Jones and too often was shovelling on poor ball as the defensive pressure mounted. 5\nAlex Tessier A fantastic 50:22 early in the second half was typical of her classy kicking, but struggled under pressure of the relentless targeting by England’s midfield defence. 6\nAsia Hogan-Rochester Raised hopes with a typical classy finish after a couple of minutes, and did so again with try in second half. Always a handful. 7\nTaylor Perry An anonymous outing for the most part, struggled in the face of the white wall in front of her. 5\nJustine Pelletier Tried to make the best of the poor ruck ball she was presented with but could not inject the required zip. Gave away a silly ruck penalty for side entry. 5\nMcKinley Hunt Was at the mercy of the England scrum from five minutes in. Hooked at half time. 4\nEmily Tuttosi Her first malfunctioning lineout throw led to the opening Kildunne try, it didn’t get any better at the set piece for the hooker. 4\nDaLeaka Menin Crumpled under the considerable pressure from Botterman. 5\nSophie de Goede Top tackler and carrier for her team, but her metres per carry figure was a paltry 0.9m. This typified both her effort and what she was up against. 7\nCourtney O’Donnell All over the shop in the lineout and absent in the loose. Came out a long way behind in a forwards dominated match. 5\nCaroline Crossley Worked hard, but found diminishing returns with both her carries and her ruck clearances. 5\nKaren Paquin Won a couple of dominant turnovers, one of which off a restart was wasted by her team. Along with De Goede the most prominent forward for Canada. 7\nFabiola Forteza One of the few who put England’s forwards on the back foot with her carrying power, but didn’t do it often enough. 6\nReplacements: Gillian Boag (for Tuttosi, 65) Shored up the lineout possession in the latter stages 6. Brittany Kassil (for Hunt, 40) Tone was set when penalised for not driving straight in first scrum 5. Olivia DeMerchant (for Menin, 68) Reduced number of penalties on her side of the scrum 6. Tyson Beukeboom (for O’Donnell, 52) Always offering to carry, and the lineout improved 6. Letitia Royer (for Crossley, 65) Little impact on ability to get over the gainline 5. Gabrielle Senft (for Paquin, 65) Didn’t make a single tackle in 15 minutes 4. Olivia Apps (for Pelletier, 52) An excellent break and increased speed of service summed up her pacy intervention in the game 6. Shoshanah Seumanutafa (for Schell, 72) Very little impact in the dying minutes 5.\nEllie Kildunne So often the flame that lights up an England display, and so it proved again. A dazzling run for the opening try and excellent in defence as well. 9\nAbby Dow Chased kicks and played her part in the defensive effort, but not much attacking threat and was outshone by her opposite number. 6\nMeg Jones A performance of quiet class, with her intelligent link play and organisation vital on both sides of the ball. 8\nTatyana Heard Saved her most influential performance for the final. Prominent with her carrying game and led the midfield blitz that stymied Canada’s verve. 6\nJess Breach Worked hard all game, but a plan designed to keep the ball mostly in the narrow parts of the field made it hard for a winger to shine. 6\nZoe Harrison Floated around, stony-faced and calm, directing the play and giving the territory that the forwards exploited. Excellent from the tee. 7\nNatasha Hunt A busy display, including an assist among the forwards for the first Matthews try. Energy belied her veteran status. 8\nHannah Botterman A nuisance at the breakdown, winning two penalties, as well as being part of the bruising scrum. Daft yellow card for a tip tackle. 7\nAmy Cokayne Poor throw gifted possession for Canada’s first try, but more than made up for it with a score of her own and brilliant darts from then on. 6\nMaud Muir Dominant in the set piece but was held up over the line and also gave away the penalty that led to Cockayne’s second try being scrubbed off. 7\nMorwenna Talling 22 tackles and a huge carry late on that set up the game-killing second Matthews try. An absolute boatload of work from the lock. 8\nAbbie Ward Made a mess of Canada’s lineout all match. Tuttosi will be seeing her in nightmares for months. 8\nZoe Aldcroft A real blindside’s performance as well as a captain’s one. Tireless in defence and stole her fair share of possession. Lost a few as well, though. 7\nPlayer of the Match: Sadia Kabeya A true hybrid performance of ferocious defence, often out in the backline, combined with big carries and intelligent handling. 9\nAlex Matthews Made plenty of hay from the base of a dominant scrum, including two tries and an assist for Ward’s score. Relentless. 9\nReplacements: Lark Atkin-Davies (for Cockayne, 60) Increased the intensity at scrum and lineout 7. Kelsey Clifford (for Muir, 58) Drove Canada backwards in scrum and loose 7. Sarah Bern (for Botterman, 60) solid set piece, but not her usual self in the loose 6. Rosie Galligan (for Talling, 69) Kept up the energy in the second row, secured the final lineout 6. Maddie Feaunati (for Ward, 69) Strangled Canada with late defensive efforts 6. Lucy Packert (for Hunt, 60) Kept the tempo up from scrum-half to close out the match 6. Hollie Aitcheson (for Harrison, 66) Calm and intelligent with her kicking 7. Helena Rowland (for Breach, 66) Led the late defensive effort out wide 6."

    "body": "Zoe Aldcroft, the England captain, said winning the Rugby World Cup was “what dreams are made of” and that winning 33 matches in a row made the case that the Red Roses team were the greatest in women’s rugby history.\nAldcroft led England to a 33-13 win against Canada at a sold-out Twickenham to cap off a dominant few years. Their last loss came against New Zealand in the 2022 Rugby World Cup final, which ended a previous unbeaten run of 30 games.\nThe Gloucester-Hartpury co-captain, who was appointed Red Roses skipper in January, said: “Honestly it is unbelievable. It is literally what dreams are made of. We have so much belief in this group, we have built something so special over the last three years and today was about sticking to our processes and believing in ourselves.\n“Everyone just had to do their own job and I think that is what everyone did today. I am just so proud of every single one of those girls. It was such an amazing occasion as well, playing in front of 82,000 people. That was next level and I think it was a chance to redefine women’s rugby.\n“We have been on this journey of ‘for the girls’, it wasn’t just about the girls in that circle but also the girls we inspire and the girls who have come before us. Also for everyone who supports us and wants to be a part of us as the Red Roses. It was just amazing. A dream come true.”\nAldcroft was also asked if she believed the World Cup trophy sealed their title as the best team in women’s rugby history, to which she replied: “It definitely feels like that. We have had 33 wins in a row, we have finally put the cherry on top of the cake with winning the World Cup. It feels great at the minute.”\nJohn Mitchell took over as head coach in 2023 with all roads leading to this final, after the team failed at the last in the previous two World Cups. The New Zealander said the triumph was among his best achievements in his almost 30-year coaching career. He said: “It’s big. To be part of a winning World Cup side is huge. Sometimes you look back and: ‘Jeez, certain tournaments elude you.’ I must admit I am only normal. Could be sitting here saying: ‘I could have brought closure to a World Cup.’ Being part of bringing closure to a World Cup is very fulfilling.\n“It’s nice to see the girls realise their potential and the staff who have worked very, very hard. We are very well resourced, I am grateful for that.”\nSign up to The Breakdown\nThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe crowd set a record attendance for a women’s rugby match with 81,885 at the home of England rugby. Aldcroft said: “The most emotional part was stepping off of the bus and seeing the amount of people in the stands and I was like: ‘Oh my goodness, this is it.’\n“Coming out to 82,000 people, it was unbelievable. You could hear them supporting us throughout the whole game. Knowing probably about 80-odd thousand for us was massive so I am so grateful and thankful to play in front of everyone today.”\nThe final win feels like a turning point for women’s rugby in England. Mitchell said: “This is just the start. What an unbelievable atmosphere. If this is the start, look out what the future is going to look like.”\nThe Red Roses will celebrate their win with an event at Battersea power station on Sunday, while England’s league season begins on 24 October."

    "section": "Football",
    "publication_date": "2025-09-27T19:00:50Z",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/27/isak-debacle-shows-newcastle-remain-stuck-outside-elite-despite-saudi-windfall",
    "body": "There is another world, not so very different from this one, in which Newcastle took the pragmatic decision early in the summer that Alexander Isak was leaving, there wasn’t much they could do about it, and they might as well make the best of it: selling players at a profit, after all, is just what clubs on the rise have to do.\nThat was always true to an extent, but has become especially so in a world governed by profitability and sustainability rules (PSR). They could have taken the £125m, bought players at their leisure, and the sense going into the season would probably have been one of quiet satisfaction at a decent summer.\nThere has, at least, been an attempt to address some obvious issues in the squad. Callum Wilson was getting old; Yoane Wissa is not only an upgrade but his pace and capacity to pull wide make him a more natural fit for the dynamic counterattacking approach Eddie Howe favours.\nAnthony Elanga brings pace and directness on the right and is probably a step up from Jacob Murphy. Jacob Ramsey adds to their creative options. There may be a sense that Malick Thiaw has not quite kicked on as many hoped he would when he first emerged at Schalke but, at 24, he’s a good young defender who adds depth and may yet develop.\nThe shadow of Isak, though, and more specifically the acrimonious nature of his departure, hangs over everything. Is Nick Woltemade better than Isak? Obviously not. But is Woltemade plus Wissa potentially better in a year or two than Isak plus Wilson? Possibly.\nIn terms of transfer value, the two pairs roughly cancel (while opening up significant PSR headroom given the nature of amortisation). But because so much emotional energy was invested in keeping Isak, Newcastle’s season has begun in a funk: not great, not terrible, but dominated by three 0-0 draws that have highlighted the absence of a high-class centre-forward.\nEven the Carabao Cup triumph has a slight taint now. How can fans settle down to watch a rerun knowing the clinching goal was scored by somebody many would be dismissing as a rat just a few months later?\nIt is both the blessing and the curse of the big one-club, post-industrial cities of the north that the identification of club and city is so strong. That’s why that victory at Wembley in March stimulated such a feeling of civic pride, but also why Isak provoked such strong reactions: in rejecting Newcastle United, he was also rejecting the city and its people.\nWhat Newcastle are going through now is the equivalent of a painful break-up, reminders of lost love materialising at every turn. That feeling is likely to be particularly acute on Sunday as they face Arsenal, against whom Isak excelled last season. He scored the winner in the league at St James’ Park – a glorious header from Anthony Gordon’s outswinging cross – and then in both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nArsenal did beat Newcastle in May, when Isak was absent, but Newcastle’s physicality unsettled them in the first three meetings of the campaign. They also beat Arsenal 1-0 at home the previous season, a series of games that has seemingly contributed to Mikel Arteta’s adoption of an increasingly physical and cautious approach.\nWoltemade did score the winner against Wolves and has produced enough nice touches while sporting distinctive facial hair to raise the possibility he could become a cult figure, but – assuming he starts – facing Gabriel Maghalães and William Saliba or Cristhian Mosquera is a whole new level of challenge.\nWhy, then, given the near-inevitability of Isak’s departure and the futility of keeping a player against his will, and the fact his sale could have been made into a positive, creating PSR headroom for significant spending, did Newcastle wait until the last minute to take the money?\nOn one level it was simply a failure of leadership. With the sporting director, Paul Mitchell, having left in June, there was a vacuum, nobody to make the decision or to present the board’s position to the public. But perhaps it stung particularly because deep in the folk consciousness of the club is a memory of the 1980s, when Newcastle were forced to sell Chris Waddle, Peter Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne, contributing to the sense of the club as a diminished entity. Isak was not, as those three were, local – but he had been taken to local hearts and become an emblem of a possible future competing with the very best.\nThere is an echo of the sale of Andy Cole to Manchester United in 1995, the same bewilderment at letting a prolific forward join a Premier League rival, but at least then Kevin Keegan appeared on the steps to explain the decision and there followed a few months later the world-record signing of Alan Shearer. Sir John Hall’s largesse in funding transfers had not stopped. Whether the Saudis remain so committed is less clear.\nAmbitious talk of a move to a new stadium in Leazes Park in March seemed a reaffirmation of their commitment, but little has happened since, beyond a petition being raised to save the park. Perhaps there will be progress now David Hopkinson is installed as chief executive, but no decisions are expected until next year at the earliest, in line with the Saudi Public Investment Fund’s (PIF) general policy of retrenchment.\nThe “strategic realignment” is particularly directed at investments outside Saudi Arabia and, while it may be true that PIF has become frustrated by PSR as a check on the pace of growth, the regulations also serve as useful cover for investors scaling back. As the Swiss Ramble football finance Substack pointed out, a £73m loss from 2021-22 falls out of PSR consideration this year, meaning Newcastle can make a loss of about £80m this financial year and still be compliant.\nAnd that’s the other – ultimately more unsettling – element of the Isak debacle. It’s not just that he will be missed; it’s what he represents. He was the symbol of Newcastle’s imagined future as an elite club with world-class players, a bellwether of the success the Saudi money could bring. Now Isak has gone, and so too has much of optimism about the transformational impact PIF’s investment could have."

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/27/nottingham-forest-sunderland-premier-league-match-report",
    "body": "For any Nottingham Forest fans still discombobulated by the departure of Nuno Espírito Santo, the manager who led them into the Europa League, the irony of losing to a team who defended doughtily, scored from a set piece then played the rest of the game with backs to the wall and reliant on the occasional counter attack for relief may not be lost on them. But as Omar Alderete’s first-half goal elevated Sunderland into the Champions League places, Ange Postecoglou’s wait for a first win as Nuno’s successor in charge of Forest stretched to a fifth game.\nThese are strange times at the City Ground. Postecoglou took an understandably low-key approach to entering the home dugout for the first time as Forest manager before the game but it was the Sunderland fans who were celebrating come full-time after Alderete, their Paraguyan defender signed for £10m from Getafe in the summer, headed in the winner.\nForest dominated throughout, and were much more forceful in the second half, obliging young goalkeeper Robin Roefs to make a sequence of excellent saves as Chris Wood had five efforts alone, but Sunderland’s obdurate defending and good organisation earned them this first away win of the season.\nPostecoglou cut a sombre figure following this latest disappointment, after making five changes to the side that had so nearly won their first Europa League game, away to Real Betis on Wednesday, before succumbing to a draw. But he pointed more to his team’s need to improve their conversion rate – they had 22 attempts at goal – than the refereeing decision that led to the only goal of the game.\nNicolás Dominguez was penalised and, adding insult to injury, cautioned for simulation after he and Trai Hume contested a 50/50 ball equally. Tony Harrington could have awarded the free-kick either way, or not at all, but when Granit Xhaka floated in his free-kick, Wood had switched off and Alderete stole in round the back to head in the deciding goal.\n“Regardless,” Postecoglou said, “even if the ref’s made an absolute howler, we can still defend the free-kick better.”\nSunderland’s gameplan and Postecoglou’s renowned style meant Forest were freed up for plenty of possession practice. They had 65% of the ball, with 90% pass accuracy. The contrast with Nuno’s approach was marked. But apart from Wood heading just off target three times in this period, twice from great crosses by Neco Williams, there was little threat of a Forest goal in the first half.\nWith only one defeat in their first six games back at this level, after their two recent promotions, Sunderland’s acclimatisation has started superbly, notwithstanding the mass turnover of players in the summer. Kudos is due to Régis Le Bris for the implementation of his strategy. But he knows his team can improve.\n“The win is important because we can’t expect anything if we don’t defend properly,” the Sunderland manager said. “We had to defend really well. “The result is really positive but when you look at different phases we have many things to improve. We have to improve for example the way we build up the play under pressure.”\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nForest needed to get their fire going again. The introductions of Morgan Gibbs-White, at half-time, and Callum Hudson-Odoi and Igor Jesus, a quarter of an hour later, helped fan the flames of the City Ground roar. Roefs was required to repel rasping efforts from Omari Hutchinson and Elliot Anderson.\nSunderland were defending as stoically in the second half as they had been strategically in the first. Hutchinson did well to beat his man and cross for Wood to sidefoot goalwards at the near post, only for Roefs to save brilliantly, and then Wood somehow glanced wide with another header from the same source. Sunderland, however, stood firm.\n“We can’t create any more chances than we did but it’s goals that win matches. We’ve got to have a much higher conversion rate,” Postecoglou said. “The players have the right mindset. A lot has happened in the past three weeks and I’ve been really stressing to the lads that we can’t dwell on the changes we’re making and the football shows they’re embracing what we’re trying to do. We’re just not turning our dominance into victories. It’s up to me to unlock that last bit.”"

    "title": "Trump is flaunting his corruption. Is it changing what the US thinks of scandal?",
    "section": "US news",
    "publication_date": "2025-09-27T18:33:34Z",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/trump-flaunting-corruption",
    "body": "As the Watergate scandal unfolded, new editions of the Washington Post newspaper were rushed over to the White House at night so Richard Nixon, the president, could brace for each devastating revelation.\nHalf a century later, Donald Trump does not seem to fear explosive front page headlines or shocking disclosures of malfeasance. Usually because he has written them himself.\nThe US president’s determination to break from his predecessors includes a willingness to shout from the rooftops of misconduct past presidents would have strained every sinew to conceal.\nAnd the consequence, observers say, is that Trump’s brazen approach earns him perverse credit for authenticity and takes the sting out of scandals that used to be career-ending when uncovered by muckraking journalists.\n“This is a dangerous notion that, just because a president chooses to be corrupt in public openly, it’s OK,” said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “People say, well, if it were really corrupt, it would be hidden. It’s a false assumption, but many people have it. It’s a new theory of scandal.”\nTrump delivered one of his most blatant examples last weekend. In a social media post addressed directly to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, the president fumed over the lack of legal action against James Comey, the former FBI director, Adam Schiff, the California senator, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general.\n  “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW,” he wrote, before deleting the message and posting another supportive of Bondi.\nIt was a glaringly obvious effort to order the justice department to take action against his political opponents. On Thursday the agency followed through by charging Comey with false statements and obstruction over congressional testimony about the investigation into contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.\nDemocrats described it as “a disgraceful attack on the rule of law”, the latest in a series of moves that have threatened the justice department’s traditional independence. But Republicans, who five decades ago forced Nixon to resign over the Watergate burglary and ensuing cover-up, were mostly silent. There was no hint of impeaching Trump over what many saw as an impeachable offence.\nRichard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, said: “It’s what prosecutors do in dictatorships. They want to run up this Comey thing that has no merit to it. That’s what they do in Russia. You piss off Putin and end up in some gulag somewhere. That’s not, I thought, how we want to run our country.”\nIf Trump’s shamelessness is one superpower, his ability to flood the zone is another. He has spent the past decade proving the thesis that while one crisis can topple a politician, a hundred crises are subject to the law of diminishing returns. “It’s Watergate, Every Day,” read a headline on the Bulwark website this week.\nIn a 2005 conversation captured on an Access Hollywood tape released in 2016, he described his approach to women: “I just start kissing them ... And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab ‘em by the pussy.”\nHe has urged foreign governments to investigate political opponents. During a 2016 campaign rally, Trump said, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” referring to rival Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails. In 2019 he publicly called on China to target Joe Biden, saying: “China should start an investigation into the Bidens.”\nIn a 2017 NBC News interview, Trump openly stated that he fired Comey because of “this Russia thing”, referring to an investigation into Russian election interference. This admission was cited in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as potential evidence of obstruction of justice, yet Trump framed it as a decisive action rather than wrongdoing.\nTrump expressed no contrition over the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 but rather persisted with his false claim of a stolen election, hailed the rioters as patriots and issued a blanket pardon of them on his first day back in office.\nIn May this year, the president said he will accept a $400m luxury plane from Qatar and use it as Air Force One, defending the arrangement as a “gesture of good faith” despite concerns that it could violate the US constitution’s emoluments clause. The Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, struck a series of lucrative deals in the Middle East.\nThe breaches have come so thick and fast that they have become unremarkable to a numbed, desensitised audience. Sabato commented: “It becomes background noise. If there’s bad news about a particular person or category of public policy then it’s less significant because you expect it. What’s Trump done today? Then you shrug your shoulders and have your third cup of coffee.”\nKurt Bardella, a political commentator, agrees that “Trump being Trump” no longer has shock value, especially since he previewed many of his actions during the election campaign. “It’s normalised versus when someone acts completely out of character: ‘Whoa, where did that come from? I never would have expected that person to act this way.’”\nThe lightning-paced news cycle makes it easy for Trump to move on from the scandal du jour, Bardella adds. “Watergate was so powerful, [Monica] Lewinsky was so powerful because it was a singular focus for an extended period of time. Now we consider a long news cycle something that lasts actually an entire week, whereas before a week was a blip on the radar.”\nEven so, Trump has faced a barrage of lawsuits, ethical complaints and demands for investigations. But Republicans control both chambers of Congress and have shown little appetite for imposing accountability. He has spent a decade purging critics from the party and reshaping it in his own image.\nWendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “The institutional structures that should be countervailing, that should be pushing up against this and saying: ‘Oh, this is terrible, he’s breaking the law’, are completely absent. They’ve been co-opted or taken over by the Republican party or the conservative supreme court.\n“There isn’t a counter voice to say to the American people this is not acceptable behaviour. I don’t think Trump gets credit for flooding the zone or that his strategy is particularly remarkable. It’s that he has neutered the Congress and bought off the supreme court. There isn’t anybody, literally, who can stop him.”\nTrump’s boasting about conduct that others would hide also strikes a particular chord with his Make America great again (Maga) support base. In an October 2016 presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton accused him of avoiding taxes for years, Trump responded defiantly: “That makes me smart.”\nIn a subsequent episode of Saturday Night Live, the comedian Dave Chappelle argued that such moments humanised Trump: his blunt admission of gaming a rigged system made him relatable, not elitist. Chappelle said: “The reason he’s loved is because people in Ohio have never seen somebody like him. He’s what I call an honest liar.”\nYears later, that still holds with the Maga faithful. John Zogby, an author and pollster, observed: “For voters who want to rage against the machine, instead of being elected president and head of the machine, he’s the guy who feels he’s been put in place to both enforce and live the rage against the machine.\n“The very fact that he breaks all the rules so brazenly – takes foreign trips and makes personal business deals – adds to the appeal. He’s the baddest cowboy in town. He does and says what a lot of people wish that they could do and say and he gets away with it. With Donald Trump, the one piece of authenticity is he is exactly what he says he is.”"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/27/crystal-palace-merited-last-gasp-win-over-liverpool-admits-arne-slot",
    "body": "Arne Slot admitted that Crystal Palace have given Liverpool plenty of cause for concern after they inflicted the champions’ first defeat of the season, 2-1, thanks to Eddie Nketiah’s late winner. The former Arsenal striker’s volley in the seventh minute of stoppage time after Liverpool failed to clear a long throw meant that Palace are the only unbeaten side in the Premier League and fare three points behind the leaders in second place.\nLiverpool – who had won their first five league matches – thought they had rescued a point after Federico Chiesa equalised Ismaïla Sarr’s opener three minutes from time after a corner. But while Slot refused to blame their defensive struggles on an inability to defend set-pieces after also conceding from two against Newcastle last month, he was honest enough to acknowledge that Palace were deserved winners.\n“They had more than only two set-piece goals,” said the Liverpool manager. “They didn’t score more, but they had chances from open play, from transition. So there were more things not to like than only defending the set-pieces.\n“The good thing was that in the other moments, Alisson saved us. Palace have a few threats. Set-pieces are one of them, but counterattack and balls in behind are number two and three. From all these situations, they’ve created a lot of chances. We were able to create quite a lot against a Palace team, which hardly ever concedes a chance.\n“But when you look at the first half, they totally deserved to win. In the second half, it was a much better performance from us. If one team deserved to win, it was Palace.”\nAlexander Isak made his first Premier League start since leaving Newcastle for a British record fee, but the Sweden striker had just six touches in the first half as he struggled before missing his only real sight of goal after the break.\n“It had a lot to do with the low intensity of the game,” said Slot. “He was close to a goal. He was very honest to stay on his feet. He got a little bit of a shirt pull. That’s why he was unbalanced when he had to shoot. He didn’t score, but quite a good performance.”\nThe Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, was full of praise for his side after a first half that he described as the best they have played since he succeeded Roy Hodgson. But the Austrian, who had to wait until the ninth match of the campaign to pick up his first win last season, warned that being unbeaten at this stage and having matched the club’s record of 18 games without defeat in all competitions counts for nothing as they prepare to face Dinamo Kyiv in their Conference League opener on Thursday.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\n“We’re still in September, so there’s nothing more to say,” he said. “Last year, we were the only team who had never won at this stage of the Premier League. They ended with a points record and winning the FA Cup. That’s why we’re always humble. We take this positivity and these positive feelings and emotions.”"

    "body": "Federal authorities in Texas have arrested a man for allegedly threatening to shoot people at a pro-LGBTQ+ parade, to avenge the murder of Charlie Kirk.\nAccording to court documents viewed by the Guardian, on 18 September, the FBI’s field office in Dallas was notified by Abilene, Texas, police about online threats from a local resident.\nThe resident, identified as Joshua Cole, allegedly used a Facebook account under the name “Jay Dubya” where he “threatened to commit a shooting” at a Pride parade in Abilene on 20 September.\n“Fk their parade, I say we lock and load and pay them back for taking out Charlie Kirk,” Cole allegedly wrote, referring to the rightwing political activist, in one comment.\nKirk was shot to death on 10 September at Utah Valley University (UVU).\nCiting investigators’ interviews with people close to the suspect in the case, Utah prosecutors have alleged Tyler Robinson killed Kirk after becoming sick of what he perceived to be Kirk’s “hatred”. Investigators reported being told by his family that Robinson had become “more pro-gay and trans rights oriented” in the year prior to Kirk’s killing.\nAnother comment Cole allegedly posted about the Abilene Pride parade read: “Theres only like 30 of em we can send a clear message to the rest of them.” Invoking an insult used to demean LGBTQ+ people, Cole also allegedly wrote: “come on bro let’s go hunting fairies.”\nIn a sworn affidavit, FBI special agent Sam Venuti wrote that investigators confirmed the “Jay Dubya” account belonged to Cole.\nVenuti said that he had attempted to contact Cole at his place of work, where he had been employed for the past year. But the employer said that Cole had “just quit” and had “stormed out of the facility in anger”, Venuti said.\nCo-workers reportedly described him as a “hot head”, according to Venuti’s affidavit.\nNot long after, local police, with Venuti present, conducted a traffic stop on Cole.\nWhen the agent told Cole that he wanted “to talk to him about his online activity”, Venuti wrote that “Cole then sighed and his body posture indicated that [he] knew the reason for our discussion”.\nVenuti’s affidavit added that Cole “did not appear surprised”.\nCole was then detained. According to the FBI, Cole waived his rights against self-incrimination and – during questioning – reportedly admitted to owning a firearm, to operating the “Jay Dubya” Facebook account and to making the threatening posts.\nThe affidavit states that Cole reportedly agreed that “a reasonable person could interpret his comments as a threat”. He also said he did “not believe that the gay pride event should be allowed” though denied “that he was going to take action or shoot parade participants”.\nVenuti concluded in the affidavit that Cole’s “threats were not conditional”.\n“The threats were specific,” Venuti wrote. “The threats were also specific to a particular set of victims: people participating in the gay pride parade.”\nBased on the evidence, the FBI agent wrote, he believed that there was probable cause to arrest Cole for violating a federal law that prohibits threatening communications.\nCole could face up to five years in prison if convicted, according to the Cornell University law school’s Legal Information Institute.\nAfter being jailed, Cole appeared briefly at a preliminary hearing, where a judge ordered him to remain in custody pending further proceedings.\nAn attorney listed for Cole did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOn 26 September, the Abilene Pride Alliance issued a public statement about the incident.\n“We want to reassure our community that the safety of everyone at Pride has always been, and will continue to be our top priority,” they wrote. “The swift action and continued diligence of [authorities] reflect their commitment to protecting our city and ensuring that Pride remains a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for all.”\nThe Trump administration – which has threatened to crack down on leftwing groups who opposed Kirk’s views – did not announce and has not commented publicly on Cole’s arrest."

    "body": "The family of Lindsay and Craig Foreman, a British couple detained in Iran on espionage charges, have said their health is deteriorating in prison.\nThe pair, both 52 and who previously split their time between Spain and England, were seized in Kerman, central Iran, and taken into custody in January while on an around-the-world motorcycle tour.\nIran said in February the Foremans were accused of entering the country “posing as tourists” to gather information. The couple, from East Sussex, deny the allegations.\nLindsay’s son, Joe Bennett, said that the family have “real concerns” about the pair’s health, and that his mother has been on a drip in prison and Craig has had several illnesses including stomach bugs and the flu.\nSpeaking to BBC News, Bennett said: There are real concerns around my mum and Craig’s health.\n“Craig is constantly ill, multiple rounds of stomach bugs, flu, dental problems, without the correct medical care.\n“It’s to my understanding that my mum was on a drip last week. Unsure as to why, but obviously very, very concerning for us as a family.”\nThis comes as the couple face court today in Iran, and the family said it is “deeply worrying” that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) appears not to have been kept informed.\nBennett told Sky News that the family was “anticipating to hear” any news after a court appearance, and “it might be seven to 10 days after today’s hearing” before they get an update.\nThe family have known little about the couple’s whereabouts or condition throughout their detention, but last month learned through the Foreign Office that Lindsay has been transferred to Qarchak women’s prison near the capital.\nHuman rights groups have repeatedly criticised the dire conditions reported at Qarchak prison.\nCraig was believed to have been moved to Tehran’s infamous central prison, also known as Fashafouyeh, which is about 30km (18 miles) south of the capital and has a similar reputation.\nThe FCDO warns all British and British-Iranian nationals not to travel to Iran because of a “significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention”.\nA spokesperson said previously: “We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.\n“We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.”"

    "body": "They think it’s all over. And finally, for England’s women, it is now. The last time the Red Roses lifted the World Cup was 11 years ago and defeat on home turf in front of a world-record 81,885 crowd would have been beyond devastating. Hence the tears of relief and shared collective joy at the final whistle as they finally brought the big one home.\nAmong other things this trophy has brought them the validation they dearly wanted and, in truth, needed. Since the introduction of full-time professional contracts in 2019, the Red Roses have won 74 of the 76 matches they have contested. The number of registered female participants in Canadian rugby would barely fill half of England’s towering citadel.\nThis was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity the hosts simply could not afford to squander and their pack, in particular, enthusiastically grabbed it with both hands.\nSo roll on the celebration after-party at Battersea power station on Sunday afternoon, the latest air-punching moment in this special summer of women’s sport. When it mattered England delivered by some distance their most convincing 80-minute performance and all the angst of past failures melted away. English rugby has spent years hailing the boys of 2003 and they now have some fresher-faced, modern-day competition.\nAnd what a memorable day it was all round. Inclusive, happy audiences, a feelgood vibe ... this tournament genuinely does seem to have captured the public imagination. Out on the concourses there were significantly more young children and teenage girls than normal. And, perhaps most noticeably of all, an awful lot more hair than Twickenham crowds usually possess. Gone were the waxed jackets and bald heads of middle England, replaced by cowgirl hats and ponytails. Goodbye, Barbour; hello, Barbie.\nYou could tell it was a full-fat Twickenham occasion hours earlier because the matchday traffic was suitably appalling. But the novelty value more than made up for such minor inconveniences. Sophie Lloyd and her electric guitar ripped it up before kick-off, the now-familiar strains of Livin’ on a Prayer were dialled up to 11 and the pre-game noise levels were up there with anything this venue has recently known.\nEven the celebs wanted a piece of it all. Justin “Red” Rose sent a message from the Ryder Cup, the Lioness Lucy Bronze was in the crowd and royal best wishes arrived from the palace. Shania Twain, sadly, had a prior engagement and couldn’t make it but, most important of all, Canada turned up big-time out on the field. When they scored the afternoon’s first try through Asia Hogan-Rochester, the same thought flashed through the mind of every English fan. They couldn’t, could they?\nIt was just as well that England had their shaggy-haired secret weapon lying in wait. If any further proof were required, after her brace of semi-final tries, Ellie Kildunne has rocket boosters in her specially designed white boots and four or five would-be tacklers were left in her wake as she swerved and surged away to register a quite brilliant individual score. “Kildunne and dusted” read a handwritten sign in the crowd but it was still way too early to relax.\nUnfortunately for Canada, it was also only half the story. While individual brilliance catches the eye, collective power is even harder to counter. England’s secondary shove in the scrums gave their opponents due warning from the outset and when they did make it into the Canada 22 their maul was its usual formidable weapon. The hungry caterpillar rarely lets England down and made the difference again here.\nCanada could have enlisted every strapping lumberjack in British Columbia and still wouldn’t have stopped the inevitable rumbles that laid the platform for England’s second and third tries and, later on, the two crucial second-half scrum penalties that snuffed out Canada’s comeback. Every time the physical effort took a little bit more out of the legs of Canada’s forwards and made it that little bit harder for them to gallop freely elsewhere.\nSign up to The Breakdown\nThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed\nafter newsletter promotion\nAnd that, ultimately, is what all that extra funding and deeper player resources gives you. When England start tiring they have the luxury of bringing on their own Bomb Squad equivalent who could just as easily start. What they occasionally lack in subtlety they more than atone for in terms of close-quarter effectiveness. John Mitchell, the head coach, and his forwards lieutenant, Louis Deacon, have not spent the last three years idly making daisy-chains.\nThe Red Roses’ ability to slow down Canada’s ruck ball was another crucial element. The ruck speed that blew New Zealand away in the semi-final was still there in patches but, at other times, there would be Hannah Botterman or Zoe Aldcroft to swoop and kill Canadian momentum at crucial moments. The player of the match, Sadia Kabeya, and Alex Matthews put their bodies on the line constantly and, defensively, it was telling when Canada, at 21-5 down, opted to kick a penalty rather than hurl themselves once more at the white barricade in front of them.\nBack on at half-time, predictably, came Bon Jovi’s tantalising message – “We’re half-way the-re!” – but surely it would now take Shania, Justin Bieber, Michael Bublé and Rush in their collective heydays to change the contest’s prevailing tune? Particularly when Abbie Ward drive ferociously low and hard for her side’s fourth, reinforcing her reputation as the toughest mother in the land.\nCanada’s gallant mini-fightback, in the circumstances, was even more praiseworthy. For this World Cup they have had to launch a million-dollar crowd-funding drive, supported by among others the Canadian band the Tragically Hip. By the time the next tournament comes around in Australia in 2029, you can only hope that more women’s teams are better funded and more sides are in a position to challenge England’s supreme queens."

    "body": "If this were a movie, the scriptwriters would be shoo-ins for an Oscar, the plot centred on a dominant team who overcame the heartbreak of losing two back-to-back Rugby World Cup finals to complete an eight-year redemption arc and become world champions again at last.\nBefore Saturday’s final, England had lost once in 63 games and that blot on their record stained everything. But no more. They are world champions for a third time and this one may taste all the sweeter for being played out in front of a world-record crowd of 81,885. The result will have apermanent effect on the sport in England.\nIt was just a few years ago when the Red Roses would run out to a few thousand fans who had stayed behind after the men had played. Now, they are turning a profit for the Rugby Football Union and securing silverware in the process. The celebrations do not stop at Twickenham, with an event at Battersea power station on Sunday.\nEllie Kildunne’s brilliant individual attacking sizzle will rightfully be in the spotlight once again with her efforts making the difference at times, but Alex Matthews and Sadia Kabeya must share some of the acclaim. The No 8 is ever-consistent in an England shirt and showed up on the biggest stage with two tries, while Kabeya, the player of the match, fronted up in defence.\nCanada were expected to start fast and it looked like it until they knocked on to set up the first scrum. Both finalists boast an impressive set-piece, but England ate them up in the first instance. Back and forth went possession, but a lost lineout allowed Canada to pounce and the first blood went the way of Asia Hogan-Rochester.\nEngland responded well and after winning penalty advantage, Kildunne danced and twisted to the line in another phenomenal solo effort. For the next period it was all about the hosts, though they fumbled two attacks as the showpiece continued to be closely fought. However, just as the catch and drive undid them in the 2022 final, it was responsible for their next try through Amy Cokayne.\nTatyana Heard intercepted when Canada looked to be creating a promising attack and while Canada’s defensive set rendered plenty of penalties, they did prevent England from scoring. That was until Matthews, who won the World Cup in 2014, sniped when England went through phases after another impressive scrum.\nCanada were in desperate need of points, but despite continually knocking on the door, England’s defence was impressive, particularly through their captain, Zoe Aldcroft. Canada won a penalty with Sophie de Goede adding three points. At half-time the score stood at 21-8 after England had a try ruled out because of obstruction in the lineout.\nLivin’ on a Prayer by Bon Jovi was the soundtrack and “we’re halfway there” never felt more suitable for England’s supporters. Whoever scored first in the second 40 would land a psychological blow and the victor of that particular element were England through Abbie Ward.\nThe New Zealand wing Braxton Sorensen-McGee ran in two tries as the Black Ferns finished third at the World Cup with a 42-26 victory over France in the playoff for bronze.\n\nThe 18-year-old star Sorensen-McGee, the tournament's leading try scorer, produced her 10th and 11th  tries of this World Cup in a comfortable win at Twickenham for the deposed champions.\n\nNew Zealand were taken apart 34-19 by Canada in the semi-finals and France faced the backlash, although Les Bleues had their moments, especially in the second half.\n\nThe Black Ferns had built a 26-7 lead by the interval with Ruahei Demant, Sylvia Brunt, Renee Holmes and Laura Bayfield crossing, rewarding their ambition in attack.\n\nFrance staged a fightback with Léa Champon, Gaby Vernier and Emilie Boulard going over, but Sorensen-McGee's finishing instincts ensured there was no danger of an upset. PA Media\nWith England’s prop Hannah Botterman receiving a yellow card for a dangerous tackle, Canada took advantage with Hogan-Rochester going in again. The Red Roses were under pressure, but a huge scrum got them out of trouble.\nScrums were England’s get out of jail free card on more than one occasion in the closing minutes and Matthews crossed the line to reward that success and seal the World Cup triumph.\nEngland had received more plaudits before the trophy lift with John Mitchell winning coach of the year. Canada’s De Goede won player of the year.\nFireworks toasted the new world champions as Aldcroft raised the trophy high. It felt like a turning point for not only this England team, but the sport as a whole. Before the final one question taunted England: could they convert their dominance into victory?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/27/us-women-single-dating",
    "body": "By 2030, 45% of prime working age women in the US, defined as women aged between 25 and 44, will be single according to Census Bureau historical data and Morgan Stanley forecasts – the largest share in history.\nHundreds of those women, from across the US, shared with the Guardian why they were single, how they felt about it and what they would be looking for in a future partner if they were still in the market for one.\n“I hated being single after my last relationship broke down,” said Sarah, 43, a sales representative from California. “I miss having someone to cook for, to share things with. But now, my motto is: ‘My alone feels so good, I’ll only have you if your presence is sweeter than my solitude.’”\nMany of the responses were surprisingly similar. The most frequently listed qualities women said they were looking for in a partner were kindness and emotional intelligence, mental and physical health, shared values, ambition and being “hardworking”, financial stability, masculinity and maturity, and a willingness to commit to an equal, monogamous relationship as well as, in many cases, having a family.\nOne of the phrases respondents used the most was that they were looking for a partner capable of “adding to” or “enhancing” their life – as in, someone who was entirely self-sufficient and capable of adding romance, children or a unique intellectual connection to their lives. A large number of women complained about past suitors who had been “lacking effort” or “unable to keep up”.\nBabet, 32, a beautician from New York City, echoed hundreds of other respondents across ages and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n“I would love to have a partner, but it seems like the men are super low effort,” she said. “Not responding on dating apps, not effectively communicating, not wanting to plan dates. A lot of men seem to actively make life for women worse instead of better … No matter what women say they look for in a relationship, it is completely ignored by men.”\nKellie, 43, from Georgia, joined the substantial number of respondents who felt that social media narratives had made dating toxic and pitted men against women.\n“I wish I could have met my person before the stupid gender wars, social media and red pill rhetoric that has ruined people’s view of dating and marriage,” she said.\nScores of women said that nobody available they had encountered met what they considered “basic requirements”.\n“I’m looking for a man who … has goals and ambition, is intelligent, trustworthy, a provider, supportive, considerate, kind, assertive, masculine, honest, faithful, intentional, has a healthy self-esteem and a sense of humour, loves to go out, and likes fitness. These basic qualities are hard to find these days,” she said.\nAlthough many women said they found being single “lonely”, they also typically said that they would not consider anyone who did not tick these or similar boxes.\nKatie, 37, a biotechnology product manager from Wisconsin, said she had felt unable to look for a new partner since her last breakup in 2021.\nA partner should ideally have “a robust social life, a focus on holistic health, compassionate and forthright communication skills, and functional independence”, she said.\n“I’m happy to compromise on things. The bar is extremely low, and yet it’s rarely cleared.”\nHundreds reported struggling to find a partner with shared values, political views and interests, and a similar education level, with many pointing to a deepening mismatch between men and women in these areas.\nDanielle, 29, a public relations professional from Tennessee, said her future partner would need to be “kind, thoughtful, emotionally available, considerate, reliable, and responsible”, but also “college educated”.\n“I’m very disheartened by the shortage of quality men,” she added. “Men my age are less educated, their social skills are abysmal, and now they’re running into the arms of Trump and ‘incel’ forums.”\nLaura, in her 40s, from San Francisco, said she had been single for the better part of a decade since her divorce despite having used many dating apps and having attended been dozens of single events.\n“There’s an imbalance between education levels now in the US. Many men don’t want to date someone who’s more educated or makes more money than them. There’s also the Peter Pan syndrome: a lot of men here don’t seem to want to grow up and take on the responsibilities of adulthood or a committed partnership,” she said.\nAlthough almost all women who were looking for a partner did not cite standout levels of professional or financial success as a priority, financial self-sufficiency was crucial for many. Various women stressed that they were searching for a socioeconomic equal.\nKelly Wallace, 48, a consultant from Portland, said: “I’m a self-employed high earner. I’m working on a memoir, own rental property and have struggled with finding someone who is like me: creative and high earning. I don’t drink or smoke and I don’t want a partner who does either.”\nWhile most women elaborated on their experience of being single in a social sense, some explained why they were legally single despite wanting to be married to their current partner.\nSusan, 40, a social worker from Ohio, said that her long-term boyfriend’s economic situation had become a permanent obstacle for marriage.\n“He wants to be working full-time with a decent wage before getting married and having a family. He hasn’t [managed that], so we haven’t moved to the next step. I’m still hoping marriage will happen, but have mostly given up on anything changing.\n“The idea of breaking up and trying to find someone else seems pretty hopeless at this age, so I’ve basically resigned myself to never having kids.”\nSome respondents reported feeling so disheartened by the world of dating that they had given up actively looking for a partner despite still wanting one, among them Raina, a 41-year-old doctor from Washington state.\n“My experience on dating apps over the last few years has been dismal,” she said.\nLike many others, Raina cited men who had not actively “worked” on their mental health as a main hurdle in her search for a partner.\n“I find most men my age have a lot of baggage and they’re not actively working to process their traumas,” she said. “It feels like taking on a partner would be like taking on another job – someone to care for physically and emotionally – when men can’t seem to offer the same to me in return.”\nShe felt “devastated” about being single “most of the time”, she added, and felt, like dozens of other women, that she was being punished for her professional and emotional progress.\n“I feel like my career and ambition have diminished my dating pool,” she said.\nKristina, 32, a mental health therapist from Chicago, said she had withdrawn from active dating after she had been dumped by someone who did not want to commit.\nAlthough Kristina reported feeling overall very happy being single, she did have concerns about her ability to have children.\n“Women are freer than ever to make their own lives outside of the confines of romantic relationships, but the ‘biological clock’ thing weighs heavily on my mind.”\nChristal Sharp, 39, a self-employed art teacher and wedding photographer from Oregon, was among many women who said drinking, drug use and other addictions among men, especially to porn, were a major factor in why they could not find a worthy partner.\n“I tried internet dating after my divorce and … I only met men who were emotionally immature, wanted [someone] to take care of them or had major addictions to drugs, alcohol, gambling, video gaming and porn. Most guys were just looking for a woman to sleep with, not grow with.”\nWhile many respondents said they would like to have a partner, others prioritised their careers, families and personal interests. In many such cases, the financial independence these women enjoyed appeared to substantially contribute to this mindset.\n“I am 35, a homeowner, have a decent income and one older child,” said Lauryn, from Connecticut.\nAlthough she would love to meet “someone hardworking, honest and loyal”, she was “very comfortable being alone”, she said.\nRandi, 33, a government policy analyst from Chicago, said she had stopped dating entirely.\n“I’m not looking for a partner because … it’s not that important to me,” she said. “I let go of the notion that a long-term relationship is an accomplishment I must fulfil to be successful.\n“I can afford my living expenses while saving for retirement. I have considered becoming a single mother via fostering or adoption. I’d rather commit to raising a child alone than go through the efforts of dating and finding a suitable partner.”\nWhile some women reported feeling happy that they could afford being single thanks to their decent incomes, others said that the financial cost of being single was the main drawback of not settling down with a partner.\n“I find dating to be more trouble than it’s worth. The one thing is that being single is very expensive,” said Nicole, 42, a high school teacher from Portland, Oregon. “The US seems designed for couples and families. Rent keeps going up, other costs are as well. It would just be nice to share the burdens with another person.”\nVarious respondents made clear that they had no intentions to couple up.\n“I’m single by choice because dating nowadays is a waste of time,” said Valerie Gregorio, a 27-year-old from Maryland.\n“I’m not looking for anyone, I value my freedom and independence too much. I still live with my family because everything is too expensive and I want to save as much money as possible, especially since I’m not making six figures currently.\n“I’m ready to accept being single for the rest of my life.”"

    "body": "After more than three decades, police have identified a dead suspect in an infamous 1991 murder case in which four girls were slain at a yogurt shop in Austin, Texas.\nAustin police revealed Friday that Robert Eugene Brashers had been identified as a suspect in the murders through “a wide range of DNA testing”. Brashers, who had a lengthy criminal history, died by suicide in 1999 at age 40 during a standoff with police in Missouri.\nThe Austin police’s announcement follows August’s release of a widely watched HBO docuseries that was based on the quadruple homicide and garnered renewed attention to the case.\nThe case’s victims were Amy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, 17 and 15, respectively, who were bound, gagged, shot in the head and then set on fire inside an I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt store in a strip mall. At least one of the girls had been sexually assaulted, authorities have said.\nJennifer and Eliza were working at the shop that night and preparing to close up when Sarah and Amy, her best friend, arrived to meet them for a ride home. According to investigators, someone snuck into the store through the back door around closing time, attacked the girls and set the store on fire. The girls, who were shot execution-style, were discovered by firefighters with their bodies bound by underwear and their mouths gagged with cloth.\nAccording to the autopsy report, Ayers was wearing small white earrings; Sarah had on a gold necklace and a Mickey Mouse watch; and Jennifer wore a high school ring as well as a Timex watch. The fire had severely charred three of the four girls, rendering them unrecognizable.\nThe case, which shocked Austin and the US, saw hundreds of potential suspects over the years but remained unsolved until recently due to a lack of solid evidence. At the time, the store had no video surveillance, and most potential evidence was destroyed in the fire.\nIn 1999, investigators arrested four men in connection with the murders, including Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott, who were teenagers at the time of the crime. Springsteen and Scott initially admitted guilt and implicated one another but later retracted their confessions, saying that they had made their statements under police pressure.\nNevertheless, the two men were tried and convicted. Their convictions, however, were later overturned when new DNA evidence identified a different male suspect, leading a judge to order their release from custody in 2009.\nThe newest suspect, Brashers, has been connected to several other cases, including the 1990 strangulation of a woman in South Carolina, the 1998 shooting of a mother and daughter in Missouri and the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee, according to the Associated Press.\nIn its statement Friday, Austin police said the case remains an open and ongoing investigation, adding: “Our team never gave up working this case. For almost 34 years, they have worked tirelessly and remained committed to solving this case for the families of Jennifer Harbison, Sarah Harbison, Eliza Thomas and Amy Ayers, all innocent lives taken senselessly and far too soon.”\nPolice said investigators “have been in touch with the families”.\n“We ask for your patience as we continue this process and remain mindful of the many people whose lives have been deeply affected by this case,” police added."

    "body": "Atlético Madrid are alive, the Metropolitano interrupting all the singing and the bouncing to erupt one last time when, deep into added time at the end of a derby day they will never forget, Antoine Griezmann slipped the ball under Thibaut Courtois to score their fifth. Yes, five, any fatalism blown away. So much for boring, so much for the title race being over already, so much for Real Madrid’s invincibility; this was a destruction that puts Diego Simeone’s side six points from the top – a gap, no longer an abyss – and it was thoroughly deserved.\nWhen that last one went in, it seemed almost absurd to recall that Atlético had been 2-1 down, that a familiar fear had hung here. This was fun instead. For almost the entire second half it had been certain too: there had been no doubts, just enjoyment, total control imposed through total conviction.\nThey had gone a goal up through Robin Le Normand, just as they had taken the lead in every game this season only to repeatedly relinquish it, and that had slipped away from them again when Madrid scored two in 11 minutes. This time though, that came back again, goals from Alexander Sørloth and two from Julián Alvarez putting them 4-2 up. Now, here was one last flourish. A manita they call it in Spain: a little hand, a goal for each finger. Clenched perhaps: it had hit Madrid hard. They arrived having won every match, nine points above their neighbours; they left having been battered.\n“No excuses, we weren’t good enough,” Xabi Alonso said. Atlético were, a wrecking ball smashing away at the edifice Alonso has been building and doing so from the very start, the noise rolling down the stands and across the pitch, rising with every run. Madrid could not deal with this. At left-back, Álvaro Carreras in particular was struggling with Giuliano Simeone, the coach’s son who plays with an intensity that is as manic as his old man.\nThey had only been playing three minutes when Atlético made their first chance and Sørloth had three of them before they finally got the breakthrough. Alone in the area, Sørloth slowed to shoot and was denied that time. The next, his header was pushed over by Courtois. And then, when Pablo Barrios caught Carreras and released him again, Courtois got there just in time. A moment later, Nicolás González struck just wide.\nJuventus missed the chance to move top of the Serie A standings at least temporarily when they were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Atalanta, coming from behind to equalise but unable to find a late winner when the visitors were down to 10 men. A second successive draw for the hosts, after opening the season with three wins, gives Napoli, the defending champions, the opportunity to move further ahead.\nThe first half was in added time when Juventus lost possession in their own half and Kamaldeen Sulemana twisted and turned his way into the area before drilling his shot through the legs of Vasilije Adzic and into the far bottom corner.\nTwo substitutes combined for the 78th-minute equaliser. João Mário’s ball into the box was mis-hit by the defender Odilon Kossounou and Juan Cabal pounced to poke home from close range.\nTwo minutes later, Atalanta's captain, Marten de Roon, picked up a second booking, but despite laying siege to the visitors’ goal, Igor Tudor’s Juventus were forced to settle for a draw against his Croatian counterpart Ivan Juric, a former Hajduk Split teammate.\nBorussia Dortmund outclassed 10-man Mainz 2-0 with goals from Daniel Svensson and Karim Adeyemi to secure a fourth straight league win that stretched their unbeaten run in the Bundesliga. \nDortmund, who host Athletic Bilbao in the Champions League on Wednesday, have now gone 13 league matches without defeat, going back to last season, and have not conceded a league goal since the first matchday on 23 August. Niko Kovac’s side are on 13 points in second place, two behind Bayern Munich, who were 4-0 winners over Werder Bremen on Friday.\nThe visitors dominated from the start and went ahead in the 27th minute when Svensson at the far post tapped in a Julian Brandt cutback. The Germany international Brandt delivered another assist after Adeyemi sprinted clear and finished the job in the 44th.\nMainz were left with 10 players when keeper Robin Zentner was sent off after bringing down Adeyemi outside the box, but by that time the game had long been decided with Dortmund in complete control. \nBayer Leverkusen needed the magic touch of Alejandro Grimaldo to set up goals for Edmond Tapsoba and Ernest Poku and earn a 2-1 victory at St Pauli. The Spain international Grimaldo floated a free-kick into the box and Tapsoba pounced on a bad clearance to rifle in from close range for a 25th-minute lead.\nSt Pauli replied through Hauke Wahl seven minutes later but Grimaldo delivered a perfectly timed assist for the 21-year-old Poku in the 58th and the Dutchman drilled the ball past Nikola Vasilj to put them back in front.\nLeverkusen, who face PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday, are fourth on eight points, seven behind Bayern. Reuters\nThe problem, though, was a recurring one: if Atlético had had a handful of clear sights already, Kylian Mbappé needed just one to wipe out all they had done, which had always been the fear. A sharp exchange with Arda Guler enabled him to spin in behind and strike a clean, low shot into a corner. At that point, it might have felt familiar. Coming into this, on average Atlético had conceded every other shot they faced, while it had taken them 10 to score. Meanwhile, this was Mbappé’s eighth league goal already.\nThat average was brought down too, a move that started right on Madrid’s own byline with Dean Huijsen smashing a clearance long ended in the net at the other end. Le Normand misjudged the flight; Vinícius Júnior escaped and pulled the ball back for Arda Guler to score. Two shots, two goals. And as if to prove the point, that fear that what happens in the areas had been undoing all Atlético do between them, in the very next minute Alvarez hit a post. That was Atlético’s seventh shot.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nThis time though, there was a way back, justice done. Madrid had scored two from two but would not score again; they would barely shoot again, in fact. And although Atlético’s equaliser would have to wait until Koke’s glorious inswinging ball was headed in by Sørloth, they did not stop there. The striker sprinted into the welcoming arms of the supporters in the south-west corner and have returned again before the break. The latest in a long line of dangerous crosses, this time from González, just evaded his forehead as he was starting to turn the tendons in his neck.\nThat left Simeone Sr on his knees over on the touchline but he would be up again, loving this. They all would. The second half had barely started when Guler tried to clear a corner, instead catching González in the chest and giving away a penalty. Alvarez, who missed one at Mallorca seven days ago, made it 3-2, another ghost exorcised and this place going wild. What an afternoon it had become. Sørloth had another superb chance and before Griezmann wrapped it all up, Alvarez curled a free-kick through the wall, the cracks in Madrid’s facade found, the foundations of this stadium shaken by the noise."

    "body": "There are ways to react to going down to 10. Some managers decide attack is the best form of defence, but Enzo Maresca has twice gone in the other direction. Chelsea’s head coach made a baffling call during last Saturday’s loss to Manchester United, responding to Robert Sánchez’s early red card by removing too many offensive players, and it was less than encouraging to see Maresca decide there was no reason to tweak his approach when his stuttering side found themselves at a numerical disadvantage against Brighton.\nThe frustration from the fans was audible as Chelsea fell back after Trevoh Chalobah was sent off early in the second half. Defensive players were introduced when Andrey Santos, Estêvão and Pedro Neto were sacrificed. Maresca had attacking options, but ignored Alejandro Garnacho, Jamie Gittens and Tyrique George.\nHe was out of substitution windows and unable to bring on a forward after Brighton, whose substitutions were far more positive and influential, took a 2-1 lead when Maxim de Cuyper scored his first goal for the club during stoppage time.\nIt was a strategic error. The rumblings of discontent at Chelsea are growing louder. They have taken one point since the international break and have lost at home in the league for the first time since December. Chalobah’s dismissal for the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity means Chelsea’s only options in central defence for next Saturday’s visit by Liverpool are Jorrel Hato, Josh Acheampong and Benoît Badiashile – assuming Maresca does not decide to bring Axel Disasi out of cold storage.\nIt is worth remembering that Maresca did not exactly hide his desire for a new centre-back after losing Levi Colwill to a long-term knee injury. His bosses disagreed. Incidentally, Behdad Eghbali, Chelsea’s co-owner, was joined by the recruitment team in going down the tunnel after full time.\nWere they heading for the home or away dressing room? Off to sign more Brighton players? This was sweet for Brighton. The celebrations were wild when Danny Welbeck’s second goal made it 3-1.\nBrighton have lost so many players and executives to Chelsea during the past three years. The enmity has grown. Brighton cherished their third consecutive victory over Chelsea. The only worry for Tony Bloom, Brighton’s owner, might be that Chelsea respond to this result by coming for one of his players. A defender, perhaps?\n“In the Premier League you cannot give away presents,” Maresca said. “We need to learn quickly.”\nMaresca transmits frustration. Building on winning the Club World Cup has been more challenging than anticipated. Chelsea are not clicking and the injuries are piling up. Cole Palmer is out for three weeks with a groin injury and the problems at the back were exacerbated when Tosin Adarabioyo and Wesley Fofana were ruled out of this game.\nTime to use that deep squad. Hato, the 19-year-old Dutch defender, joined Chalobah in central defence and there was a first league start for Santos, whose initial drive in midfield was central to Chelsea’s early dominance.\nIt was not a surprise when they led after 24 minutes, Moises Caicedo releasing Reece James on the right and the captain delivering for Enzo Fernández to head in his third goal of the season. “Chelsea dominated,” Brighton’s manager, Fabian Hürzeler, said. “After the goal everything changed. We played with more courage.”\nChelsea, who lined up with four former Brighton players, dipped after half-time. The momentum shifted when James, who tired at right-back, went off for treatment after jarring his knee. A mixup followed, Santos inadvertently poking the ball to Diego Gómez, who was through on goal and just outside the area when he was brought down by Chalobah.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nSimon Hooper, the referee, was having such a bad game that it required him to check the pitchside monitor to confirm Chalobah had to be sent off. Brighton stirred. Maresca threw on Acheampong, Malo Gusto, Roméo Lavia and Badiashile. The pressure grew. Hürzeler introduced Welbeck and moved the outstanding Yankuba Minteh to the left flank.\nFaced by no counterattacks, Brighton pushed up and probed. Minteh and Welbeck missed chances. Eventually they combined, Minteh dancing past Gusto and crossing for Welbeck to head in the equaliser.\nGusto, Maresca said, was on to help James deal with Minteh. Nothing worked for Chelsea and their composure disappeared. There was a brawl after Brighton appealed for a penalty.\nBrighton led when Yasin Ayari’s cross led to two substitutes combining, Mats Wieffer heading across for De Cuyper to score.\nShort of attacking outlets, Chelsea folded. It was over when Welbeck danced through and lifted a shot over Sánchez. Maresca has problems to solve."

    "body": "With its lightning ball-recycling that swept play left to right and then back into the area for a second Maxime Estève own goal, Manchester City’s third was a picture of their dominance under Pep Guardiola before last season’s decline.\nJérémy Doku raced inside from the left and found Phil Foden, whose instant turn-and-pass to Matheus Nunes scattered Burnley. The right-back’s cross was smacked in at velocity and Oscar Bobb’s attempt rebounded off Estève and past Martin Dubravka.\nThe 65th-minute strike left Guardiola hugging Pep Lijnders, his assistant, and will surely be pointed to by the manager as the blueprint City need to consistently call upon. Until this, his team had been ponderous, lacking the slickness that befuddles most foes.\nGuardiola said: “We started the game really well, but after we dropped [off]. In the second half we found the goals and it was much better in the last 20 minutes.”\nScott Parker’s disappointment reflected this, too. “5-1 does feel harsh – for 70 minutes we were right in this game and we caused City some problems,” said Burnley’s manager.\nCity kicked off holding a 12-1 aggregate lead from the past three meetings and inside 15 minutes it became 13-1. Doku’s fine early-season form continued as he burst in from the left and shot; Dubravka palmed the ball straight to Foden, whose hit, at close range, pinged off Estève for his first own goal of an unfortunate outing.\nWith Rodri unavailable – Guardiola said the midfielder told him on Friday he was not fit enough to play, with pain in a knee – Nico González deputised, and one effort from him was deflected for a corner he flicked on for Erling Haaland, who marginally missed his connection. It came after another Doku thrust down the left was followed with a sharp shot the busy Dubravka repelled.\nAfter a Friday eulogy about the returning Kyle Walker, Guardiola’s programme notes did not mention the former captain, who left on loan for Milan in January before summer’s permanent move to the Clarets. If this was a mere oversight, there was 20-20 vision from Foden when racing back to defend: from the left, Lyle Foster ran in and passed to Josh Laurent, and when he shot Foden was a barrier who blocked.\nThey required a similar act from Rúben Dias when Quilindschy Hartman received on the left and crossed. But, caught square, Dias failed. Jaidon Anthony blazed at goal, the ball knocked the inside of the defender’s right ankle and Gianluigi Donnarumma was beaten.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nWhat a fillip for Burnley as the interval approached. It again exposed a soft City core that has opponents sniffing blood when attacking. At play is, partly, the loosening of his team’s former stranglehold – a corollary of Rodri’s absence; both here and for most of the past year. Another factor is the rearguard’s paucity of pace – Walker’s speed is a serious miss.\nAs documented in City’s All or Nothing Amazon series, Guardiola has form for delivering impassioned team talks. If one was delivered at half-time he still had to watch Foster threaten to give Burnley the lead, the attempt hitting Nunes.\nWhen Tijjani Reijnders had a shot at the other end it followed precise Doku-González interplay; the midfielder sprayed wide, but City’s next foray yielded gold. Haaland, falling back, nodded across the area for Nunes to smash in to provoke joy – and relief – in sky blue ranks.\nCity finally located their high gear via the Doku-Foden-Nunes-Bobb combination that caused Estève’s second dose of ill-luck.\nThis was contest over, but there was still time for Doku, yet again, to help pierce Burnley. A dribble preceded a pass to Haaland and he made no mistake. Nor did Haaland when running through after a defensive horror show involving (again) the hapless Estève. Dubravka was allowed no chance."

    "body": "Could things get any better for Crystal Palace? Now the only unbeaten side left in the Premier League having stretched their run to club record 18 matches thanks to this dramatic late victory over champions Liverpool, Palace are about to embark on their first European tour when they face Dinamo Kyiv in the Conference League on Thursday and have a manager that is proving to be a bit of a genius.\nArne Slot’s expensively assembled side thought they had kept up their run of rescuing late points when Federico Chiesa equalised Ismaïla Sarr’s opener. But the winning goal came from another substitute as Eddie Nketiah’s volley in the seventh minute of stoppage time recorded their first victory against Liverpool here since November 2014 and sent the home supporters wild. While Marc Guéhi put in another faultless performance against the club that came so close to signing him earlier the month and even provided the assist for Nketiah’s clincher, above all this was a triumph for the system that has been implemented by Oliver Glasner since he arrived in south London 18 months ago. On this form, Palace are a match for anyone.\nContinuity has been one of the keys to their recent success and the return of Sarr – who scored in a third successive game against Liverpool – from injury meant Glasner was able to name the same team that started the FA Cup final and Community Shield, apart from new signing Yeremy Pino replacing the departed Eberechi Eze.\nLiverpool still haven’t settled on their first choice XI after a busy summer of recruitment. Having spent almost a combined £250m on Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, Slot probably felt compelled to start them both – especially after Hugo Ekitiké’s unhelpful red card in midweek ruled him out of contention. But Liverpool looked a far cry from the team that started this season with five straight wins as Palace seized the initiative in the first half.\nAs well as possessing a rock solid defence, Glasner’s side have also become lethal from set-pieces under the Austrian – as Liverpool found to their cost in the ninth minute. Virgil van Dijk’s loose pass was intercepted by Tyrick Mitchell and after breaking upfield, Palace won a corner that was contested by Slot and his backroom team. But the impressive Daichi Kamada’s inswinger was headed by Ryan Gravenberch under pressure from Guéhi and it fell perfectly for Sarr to sweep home. It should have been 2-0 in the next attack when Kamada pinched the ball off Gravenberch but Pino could not convert Sarr’s cutback.\nLiverpool looked stunned and they had to wait almost five minutes to take a free-kick after a medical emergency in the crowd that required the intervention of medics. All was well in the end before Mohamed Salah hit the wall and a brilliant save from Dean Henderson somehow diverted Gravenberch’s piledriver on to the post. The direction of traffic was largely one way, however, and only two stunning saves from Alisson kept Liverpool in touch. First the Brazilian did well to scoop Daniel Muñoz’s effort off the line before he stood tall against Jean-Philippe Mateta in a one-on-one.\nIbrahima Konaté had endured a particularly testing afternoon having earlier been booked for hauling down Mateta but the France defender was inches away from equalising when he headed Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner wide. Palace’s dominance was underlined by the fact that Isak recorded only his sixth touch of the first half during 10 minutes of stoppage time that were added on. Another flowing move started by Maxence Lacroix’s stunning pass ended with Mateta striking the post with a curling effort before he blasted just over on the volley. Half-time couldn’t come soon enough for Liverpool, while Palace left the field to a deserved standing ovation.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nIt was inevitable that Slot would make a change but it was perhaps surprising to see the ineffective Wirtz stay on. Instead, Conor Bradley was replaced by Cody Gakpo as Szoboszlai reverted to right-back and the German moved into midfield. He seemed much more at home there than stuck out on the left flank, with Wirtz setting up Gakpo for a shot that wasn’t far away from Henderson’s post before forcing the Palace goalkeeper into a point-blank save from Szoboszlai’s cross that he really should have scored from.\nIsak was the next to spurn a big chance after wriggling his way into the penalty area before firing wide. “What a waste of money,” sang the Palace supporters. Liverpool camped out in their half as they pushed for a way back into the game. But it needed a mistake from Chris Richards when he failed to clear Gravenberch’s cross to allow Chiesa to slam home the equaliser and keep up their record of having scored in their last 39 league games. But Nketiah made sure this was another afternoon to savour for Palace when he chested down Guéhi’s flick-on and provided the killer blow after the visitors failed to clear a long throw from Muñoz deep into stoppage time."

    "title": "Build prefab homes to address harm to ‘generation of homeless children’, says Labour MP",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/27/build-prefab-homes-to-address-harm-to-generation-of-homeless-children-says-labour-mp-siobhain-mcdonagh",
    "body": "A Labour MP has called for the government to start building prefabricated homes in England to address the “terrible things” happening to a generation of homeless children.\nDame Siobhain McDonagh, who helped found an all-party parliamentary group aimed at supporting record numbers of families in temporary accommodation after being “completely overwhelmed” by the amount of cases in her constituency, said the situation was “devastating”.\nThe number of homeless people has risen steadily over the past few years as Britain faces a shortage of about 4.3m houses. The most recent government statistics show there were 131,140 households in temporary accommodation in England, including 169,050 children, at the end of March. This is the highest figure since records began in 1998, and an increase of 11.8% on the previous year, before Labour took power.\nMcDonagh added that she hoped parliament would urgently process Labour’s flagship renters’ rights bill in an effort to stem the tide of no-fault evictions, a major driver of homelessness. The party was elected on a promise to ban the practice “immediately” but the bill has not yet been made law more than a year after the election as Labour considers a number of amendments made in the House of Lords. The housing charity Shelter estimates that in England about 32,000 families have approached their local authority for housing assistance following a no-fault eviction notice since last July’s general election.\nResearch by McDonagh’s group also found that the conditions in temporary accommodation had been linked to the deaths of at least 74 children since 2019.\nSpeaking before Labour’s annual conference, which is due to begin in Liverpool on Sunday, McDonagh said: “The truth is, we don’t know how children are being harmed. We’ve got statistics on infant mortality but we are doing terrible things to a generation of children. A lot of the factors, because it was very young children [who died], was access to a safe sleeping space and the provision of cots.\n“Beds and bed configuration are a big issue in temporary accommodation. You’ve got parents and children sharing beds, you’ve got siblings sharing beds. Most temporary accommodation is basically furnished and the configuration of beds can often be not suitable for families.\n“The issues of damp and mould growth exacerbate the conditions families already have – asthma and general bronchial stuff. Obviously, there are consequences to not having access to a kitchen. People rely on takeaways, so obesity is an issue. Temporary accommodation is small, so you’ll have issues with children learning to walk.”\nMcDonagh said local authorities were obliged to provide cots for children under two but it was “difficult to know” if this always happened in practice. She added: “Some councils are under immense pressure and the realities of what families get access to and what it’s claimed they get access to are two very different things.”\nMcDonagh, who has been the MP for Mitcham and Morden in south London since 1997 and served as a whip under Gordon Brown, said she was aware of some homeless families from the south-east of England being accommodated as far away as Scotland and Wales, meaning children’s education is severely disrupted.\nShe added: “I think there needs to be a mission in the short term to provide more temporary accommodation. People were delighted by the prefabs [built after the second world war] and they outlived their life expectancy. The benefit is you can use quite small pieces of land.\n“It’s just so desperate. It’s killing councils. They are falling over financially because they just can’t afford the rising costs. I think the renters’ [rights] act will have a big impact because landlords won’t be able to evict people so quickly for no good reason and the chase for ever-higher rents is made more difficult.\n“Labour has a problem in the Lords because there are so few compared to the combined forces of the Conservatives, the Liberal [Democrats] and the crossbenchers. It’s really very difficult to get things through the Lords at the moment.\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\n“The real solution in the long term can only be building more social housing. I can understand why the government wouldn’t want to spend money on temporary [accommodation], but I think we have to. You wouldn’t choose to do that, but you need something that is quick.”\nSince Labour’s general election win, 11,400 households in England have had their homes repossessed by bailiffs following a no-fault eviction order – an increase of 8% from the previous year. Charlie Trew, the head of policy at Shelter, said: “If the bill doesn’t pass until 2026, we think that at least 3,000 more households are going to be marched out of their homes by bailiffs.”\nEmer Sheehy, a policy manager at Citizens Advice, said the charity was supporting about 100 people a day facing a no-fault eviction – known officially as a section 21 eviction.\nThe government says it plans to build 1.5m new homes by the end of this parliament to address the housing crisis in England. However, Hannah Aldridge, a senior research and policy analyst at thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said the “ongoing fall” in the number of properties given planning permission “casts doubt” on its ability to do so.\nA Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “Every child deserves a safe and secure start to life, and somewhere to call home.\n“That’s why we’re investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to get families out of temporary accommodation.\n“And we are banning section 21 no-fault evictions and building more social and affordable homes with £39bn investment, to give families housing security.”"

    "body": "It was a day when Leeds realised the harsh realities of being a Premier League team. Two lapses in concentration allowed Bournemouth to leave with a point, preventing the home side from securing back-to-back victories.\nAntoine Semenyo was allowed to drill a first-half free-kick under the wall and past a draught excluder of insufficient length. Ironically, Leeds got themselves back into the game thanks to set pieces; Joe Rodon and Sean Longstaff turned things around from corners and Leeds battled to hold on, only to leave Eli Kroupi in space, from where he volleyed home an injury-time leveller.\nTo go with the defensive mistakes at critical moments, Leeds were also left to rue Dominic Calvert-Lewin missing three excellent chances before Bournemouth took the lead. The summer signing could have netted his first goal at Elland Road as a Leeds player within 15 seconds after being sent through on goal. Instead, a duel with Djordje Petrovic began, which would create the early narrative. The goalkeeper came out on top each time thanks to his reflexes and the poor finishing.\n“Normally he scores in this situation,” Daniel Farke said. “If he keeps going like this, I’m pretty sure he will score. Just one team was missing big chances today: that was us, not Bournemouth. In the first half we had more than enough chances to win probably two Premier League games, we missed all of them.”\nLeeds were left even more irritated by those misses in the 26th minute when Semenyo thrashed a free-kick from the edge of the area under the wall, defeating the diminutive Brenden Aaronson, who was lying down at the time, and the goalkeeper Karl Darlow, who was not quick enough when it came to reaching the turf.\nConsidering the proximity of the ball to the goal, there was no need for the wall to jump, but instinct took over. It was the first Leeds have conceded at home this season, but also showed that tiny mistakes are capitalised on at this level.\nLeeds’s promising start was looking wasted, as poor decision-making and tentative play crept in. Semenyo’s strike had the opposite effect on Bournemouth, who found their rhythm and increased the tempo when they were in possession, thinking a second could finish the contest, but Leeds are more than happy to fight their way back into a match. They know points procured at home with be imperative this season.\n“Leeds is a team with a soul,” said Andoni Iraola. “That made it difficult for us. Four goals came from set pieces and the game has been for me very, very physical. We struggled in the duels, not only in set pieces.”\nA moment was required to change the direction of the game and it came via Rodon. Leeds’s height means they are dangerous from set pieces. Longstaff sent a cross to the back post, the Wales centre-back rose and headed towards goal, defeating Petrovic thanks to a Semenyo flick. This restored the volume at Elland Road and decibels will be key when intimidating visitors.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nBournemouth came out after the break looking calm with the aim of controlling possession. Leeds, however, have plenty of desire to call upon when required. That became evident eight minutes into the second half when Longstaff got off the mark for Leeds with a precision half-volley that cannoned in off the post. Elland Road went wild for the midfielder, but Gabriel Gudmundsson deserved a similar amount of praise for his endeavour to keep the ball in play after recycling a corner. It summed up the attitude of the team, while Longstaff showed there is plenty of quality to go with it.\n“We fully deserve to have games on this level,” Farke said. “We fully deserve to be in this best league in the world and out of this we will also gain more and more confidence.”\nLeeds were looking to kill the game off but almost came unstuck when Kroupi found space in the box, only to fluff his finish. The warning was not heeded and when David Brooks’s free-kick was headed down by Marcos Senesi, the teenager showed why Bournemouth invested in his composure, while Ethan Ampadu switched off. Not that Iraola could put a price on silencing Elland Road after a battle."

    "body": "You’ve got to hand it to the reliably prolific pain-content generator that is Manchester United. Even at the end of a performance that was, if nothing else, a perfect example of empty and bloodless systems football, 90 minutes that felt like watching a robot with a cold go for a walk, this thing can still offer you stories, mini-arcs, narrative Easter eggs.\nThe only shame is we will have to wait another six months, April at Stamford Bridge, to see if Bruno Fernandes can complete the perfect hat-trick of weirdly missed west London penalties.\nAt Fulham a month ago Fernandes became very angry after a minor collision with the referee, then whumped the ball into the crowd. Four miles west of Craven Cottage, with Manchester United 2-1 down to an energetic Brentford, there was a more nuanced take on the delayed Bruno west London spot-kick fluff plot device.\nThis time he was subjected to an interlude of mental disintegration by the video assistant referee, who took three minutes to decide Nathan Collins had not, repeat not, impeded a goalscoring opportunity by pulling back Bryan Mbeumo eight yards from goal with the ball heading his way. Enough for an obvious penalty. Not enough to qualify as a goalscoring opportunity. Maybe Mbeumo should sue for defamation.\nProbably there was some really good logic behind this, shorthand for four hyped-up guys babbling jargon at each other in a sweaty room. It was process. It was an application of the guidelines. It was also just nonsense.\nIn the middle of this Bruno was also nudged a little by Keith Andrews, who made a double substitution that stretched out the wait. A mid-penalty substitution. Ever seen it before? All this time Bruno held the ball, tried to look centred, calm, earthed, while invisible non-football happened. The kick was weak, but also well saved.\nAnd for United the game never came back from there, the only real tension the amazing lengths Ruben Amorim was willing to go to in order to preserve intact his laughably totalitarian “system”, like a juggler whirling around a bowling ball, a sword and a piece of sponge cake. Behold my miraculously ineffective 3-4-2-1, now available with six midfielders, a pigeon, a sandwich and Jim Leighton at wingback.\nNathan Collins was behind Bryan Mbeumo and pulled him back. Craig Pawson awarded a penalty but Collins was only booked. The challenge was looked at by the video assistant referee but he did not recommend a review.\n\nLaw 12 says: \n\nWhere a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.\n\nIt continues:\n\nThe following must be considered: \ndistance between the offence and the goal\ngeneral direction of the play\nlikelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball\n\nThe Premier League match centre said on social media that Mbeumo was deemed not to be in control of the ball.\nAfter the game Amorim blamed his team’s wretched performance on the players. Also on the referee. Also on Brentford for playing an aggressive game, dammit. The reality is this: at any normal club unscarred by other recent sackings, Amorim would now lose his job.\nThe prize at the Gtech was the hilariously abject prospect of back-to-back league wins for the first time under a manager who has been there for almost a year. In that time Amorim has achieved only one thing. A team that seemed previously to be bad for diffuse macro reasons of culture and ghosts in the walls are now bad in a highly specific Amorim-shaped way.\nHe has at the very least built a team in his own image. And yes, that image is reliably flawed, a pencil sketch from a textbook placed over ragged, complex human life by a manager who advertises to his opponent exactly what he’s going to do and then seems shocked each week to find himself getting mugged.\nBut there was at least a first here. This might sound harsh. But even the missed penalty is arguably Amorim’s fault. At the very least the manager deserved a miss-assist. What position is Fernandes playing in these days? Deep pivot, arguably, sentenced to that role as he’s the only person at the club still in favour with the boss who can play on the half turn.\nIn the process new patterns are being run. The assists and goals from open play have dried up. Here he is in a tight game stepping up to take a vital penalty, fried and rejigged, un-Brunoed, and looking for the first time anything other than totally relaxed. What do we we expect in this scenario? Business as usual?\nAnother slow start also seemed to baffle Amorim, to the extent he again blamed Brentford for this afterwards. It is obvious watching this team why they start badly. The players begin each game looking like they’re in a state of buffering, regurgitating information, remembering patterns and shapes, unable to engage emotionally with the game or with what their opponents are doing.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nYou can feel this anti-energy flowing from a manager who came into Old Trafford all smiles and swagger and elite menswear, like a handsome sexy pirate; but who now spends every game clenching and squatting and walking in small circles, the look of a man trying very hard not to shit himself. Which, in effect, he is.\nHere from the first minute he was waving his arms, shouting, exasperated even with his team in possession at some detail of spacing or bunching. Is it helping? Would this help anyone to do anything of any kind at any level?\nThere was a telling moment 2-0 down with 20 minutes gone and with United being marched around the pitch in a headlock, when Amorim’s players urgently lined up for the restart, all 10 of them to the left hand side. Don’t worry about the utterly bloodless performance. We still have an obscure but well-worked set piece restart for you.\nAnd as ever it’s the system, stupid. It’s the stupid system. Let us take these oddly sourced parts, a fish finger, four walnuts, Casemiro, and bake them into a workable meal, but only, and I will not compromise on this, if I can do it in the shape of a bicycle. That is my one, unshakable principle. And here every player in the team underperformed or looked confused.\nA long pass was all it took to create the first Brentford goal. Igor Thiago’s finish was astonishing, perhaps for him too. But what kind of manager asks Harry Maguire to play a high line, to defend large spaces, and is then surprised when this doesn’t work? Hey, what’s a guy got to do to get a payoff around here?\nThe wingbacks were dreadful. Patrick Dorgu is good at running, but it’s more like he’s doing a cross-country quite near some other people playing football. Benjamin Sesko scored an opportunist goal. The penalty miss came and went. And Brentford were always, always winning this game.\nThe one certainty at the end of an abject 3-1 defeat is that nothing will shift here. Ruben-ball will be back next week, somehow. Stay tuned for more of exactly the same."

    "body": "Ruben Amorim lamented a lack of control, composure and character from his Manchester United team at both ends of the pitch as they fell to the latest defeat of his troubled tenure, going down 3-1 at Brentford.\nBruno Fernandes missed a 76th-minute penalty at 2-1 after the Brentford defender, Nathan Collins, avoided a red card for his last-man foul on Bryan Mbeumo in front of goal. But it was not a day for Amorim to point the finger at the officials, rather to reflect on how his players had failed to carry out his instructions from the training ground – particularly in terms of defending against quick long balls on transitions.\nBrentford were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes from that route, Igor Thiago providing both of the finishes, with Amorim unhappy Matheus Cunha was not given a free-kick on the edge of the opposing area before the first. It would have been a soft decision.\nAmorim was troubled by his players’ inability to handle setbacks. “We can settle down the game,” he said. “That is something that I know this team can do. But when everything … the moments, the penalty [miss], the foul before the first goal … all these things are against us, we need to have more personality to control the games, calm down the games and then play back. I feel that sometimes when things are really hard, they are not the same. But that is the pressure of the club.”\nAmorim made attacking substitutions, introducing Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee but remaining true to his 3-4-2-1 system. He ended up with Mbeumo at right wing-back and Mount at left wing-back. He has previously said that not even the pope could make him change his system.\n“When we win it’s not the system; when we lose it’s the system,” Amorim said. “I understand that. It’s more that we play this game like Brentford wants us to play this game. We never play our game. We never push the opponent.\n“We knew that every time they recover the ball, they will make a run and they will fight for the ball. We suffered two goals like that. We suffered goals in transition that we knew during the week and we worked on that. The frustration is that every goal, the goals today, we work on that during the week.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\n“We can do better with the ball. We can have more control. My biggest concern is we didn’t settle down the game. In the final third, we missed a lot of crosses. I think it’s clear that we can create more chances. We had a little bit of a lack of quality in the final third.”\nOn the possible red card for Collins, who did not appear to attempt to play the ball, Amorim said: “The referee told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled. I want, especially in these kind of moments, not focus on the referee.”\nAmorim insisted once again that he could turn around United’s fortunes. He has taken 34 points from 33 Premier League games since his appointment last November.\n“We can play better and we need to play better,” he said. “It’s ups and downs. When you win, you feel that everything … the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for one win that can help you to create the momentum. If I win, I’m in a different state of mind. That is normal, but I’m always confident because I know what to do. So guys, I’m always doing my job.”"

    "body": "From TS Eliot and Ted Hughes to Carol Ann Duffy and Simon Armitage, numerous poets have written a few plays. However, Tony Harrison’s collected plays run to six volumes, comprising 19 full-length dramas. Many of them are translations from Greek (The Oresteia, from 1981, is the most actable version of the trilogy by Aeschylus) or French (he did an astonishing rhyming version of Molière’s The Misanthrope in 1973). But, as Harrison’s theatre career developed, he also wrote original plays, of which The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus (1990) and Square Rounds (1992) stand as the best new verse dramas written in English since Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral in 1935.\nThe English versions of foreign dramas were a dividend from the extraordinary education in classics and languages available to a working-class child at Leeds Grammar School in the 1950s, before he extended his knowledge of Latin and Greek at Leeds University.\nThe poet-critic Sean O’Brien has observed that Harrison’s printed verse “insists that it is speech rather than page-bound silence”, and this vivid verbal quality led logically to writing words for performance by others.\nIt was while teaching at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria from 1962-66 that Harrison wrote his first play, collaborating with a colleague on Akin Mata (1964), a vernacular version of Lysistrata, Aristophanes’ comedy about a pacifist sex-ban by Greek women. Harrison suppressed this text, although some have argued that the strongly visual and ritualistic nature of African theatre influenced his later stage work.\nBack in England in the early 70s, Harrison was picked by the director John Dexter to solve the problem of why French classic dramas rarely succeeded in English. The technical difficulty was the favoured Parisian style of alexandrine rhyming couplets, which frequently rely on soft and half-rhymes that are more elusive in English, encouraging translators towards blank verse or prose. Dexter set Harrison to translate Molière’s Le Misanthrope and Racine’s Phèdre while fully respecting their rhymes and 12-syllable rhythm.\nAfter much experimentation, delivering his drafts aloud while walking northern moors, Harrison perfected a compression technique, through lines such as “The loved one’s figure’s like Venus De Milo’s”, which had a speedy, speakable beat. By relocating the Racine to the period of English rule in India, Harrison also ingeniously widened the rhyme store: “Raj”/“sabotage”, “degrees”/“rupees”. Both starring Diana Rigg, Harrison’s The Misanthrope and Phaedra Britannica, staged by the National Theatre at the Old Vic in London from 1973-75, were hits that still make pleasurable reading.\nOne of Harrison’s signature stories about the English class system was of going to the gents on one of his first nights and returning to find his father beside the auditorium door, looking in bewilderment at his hand, filled like a tout’s outside a sports stadium. “People keep giving me their tickets,” said his dad, whose Sunday best had convinced the smart-casual middle classes he must be an usher.\nWhen the National moved to the South Bank in the mid 70s, artistic director Peter Hall set Harrison another frequently-failed theatrical test – rendering Greek drama into lines suited to be said rather than read. His solution in The Oresteia involved, as with the French texts, compacted content, this time through frequent hyphenated neologisms such as “grudge-dogs” and “blood-ooze.” Insistent on the actors keeping the exact syllabic beat, Harrison described his role in the rehearsal room, with characteristic wit, as “the man who came to read the metre”.\nEver since being ticked off at school for his translations being too “demotic” (as described in his poem Classics Society), Harrison hankered after a literary rhetoric reflecting Yorkshire speech. He achieved this brilliantly in The Mysteries, first performed at the National Theatre in 1977. Harrison reshaped the medieval religious plays performed by workers’ guilds in Wakefield, York and elsewhere into three plays – The Nativity, The Passion and Doomsday – that take a whole day to perform in full. Apart from Yorkshire vocabulary and vowels, the linguistic signature in The Mysteries was aggressive alliteration. Creating the world, God fills the sea with “fish to flit with fin / Some with scale and some with shell”.\nOne reason that Harrison gravitated towards writing plays from scratch was frustration that even the most acclaimed translations are rarely revived, theatres tending to commission new versions. The dramatic move had also been influenced by immersion in television. In 1984, he had written The Big H for BBC Two with composer Dominic Muldowney, a music-drama for children based on the Herod story. He also worked with BBC producer Peter Symes on a series of film-poems with verse commentaries, including The Blasphemer’s Banquet (1989), about the death threat imposed on the writer Salman Rushdie.\nHarrison’s first theatre original, The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, ingeniously entwined expanded fragments of a lost satyr play by Sophocles with the story of the archaeologists who found them. Its successor, Square Rounds, examined the morality of scientists through the stories of the inventors of the machine gun and chemical weapons. The inventive staging incorporated live magic tricks, but audiences stayed away, and the then NT artistic director, Richard Eyre, recorded it in his published diaries as “a kind of noble disaster” that he should have done more to improve. \nEyre himself staged The Prince’s Play (1996), a version of Victor Hugo’s Le Roi S’Amuse, which channelled the anti-monarchist views that would lead Harrison to exclude himself, in the poem Laureate’s Block, from consideration for the role of poet laureate. Fram (2008), about Arctic exploration, felt unready for the stage, and was his last collaboration with the National, although The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus and Square Rounds both looked impressive on revival at London’s Finborough theatre in 2017-18.\nDespite lacking a thirst to sip the Queen’s sherry as national bard, Tony Harrison became, across four decades, the National Theatre poet."

    "body": "Vladimir Putin will expand his war in Ukraine by attacking another European country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has predicted, and accused Russia of recent drone incursions that he said were an attempt to test Nato’s defences.\nSpeaking in Kyiv after his meeting with Donald Trump at the UN in New York, the Ukrainian president said Russia was preparing for a bigger conflict. “Putin will not wait to finish his war in Ukraine. He will open up some other direction. Nobody knows where. He wants that,” he said.\nUkraine’s president said the Kremlin was deliberately checking Europe’s capacity to protect its skies, after drone sightings in Denmark, Poland and Romania and the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets. More drones were spotted on Friday night above a Danish military base, and over a Norwegian base on Saturday.\nZelenskyy suggested EU governments were struggling to deal with this new and dangerous threat. Earlier this month, Ukraine spotted 92 drones flying towards Poland in a “choreographed” way. It intercepted most of them. Nineteen crossed into Polish territory, where the Poles shot four down.\n“I am not comparing our forces. We are at war and they [Poland] are not,” he said. Zelenskyy said representatives from several unnamed countries would travel to Ukraine to receive “practical training” in how to repel Russian aerial attacks. “We are ready to share our experience,” he added.\nZelenskyy’s remarks follow what he said were “very nice” talks with Trump on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. After the meeting, the US president said he believed Ukraine could win back all the territory it has lost since 2022, with the support of Europe and Nato.\nSign up to Headlines Europe\nA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day\nafter newsletter promotion\nTrump also said Russia’s economy was in big trouble and described its military as a “paper tiger”. Asked to explain this apparent warmer tone towards Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he had briefed Trump about the realities on the battlefield. He told him Russia’s advances were often fleeting: “It’s not success. It’s temporary presence.”\nThe US president now had greater “faith” in Ukraine and has discovered that Russia treated him and everyone else with “disrespect”, Zelenskyy said. He declined to comment on reports that he had asked the White House for US Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of striking Moscow, saying: “It’s a sensitive issue.”\nIn recent months Kyiv has carried out a series of successful strikes against Russian oil refineries using domestically produced long-range drones. Zelenskyy said that if the Kremlin tried to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure again this winter its own capital will experience retaliatory blackouts."

    "body": "US military officials are reportedly bracing for possible firings or demotions after the Trump administration’s Pentagon chief, Pete Hegseth, abruptly summoned hundreds of generals and admirals from around the world to attend a gathering in Virginia in the upcoming days.\nThe event, scheduled for Tuesday at Marine Corps University in Quantico, is expected to feature a short address by Hegseth focused on military standards and the “warrior ethos”, according to the Washington Post.\nThe order to attend the meeting, which has been described as unusual and unprecedented, was reportedly issued with little explanation – and prompted military personnel stationed overseas to have to make last-minute travel arrangements.\nThe Pentagon has not disclosed details about the meeting or its agenda. But a senior Trump administration official told the New York Times on Friday that Hegseth intends to deliver a “rally the troops” message – and that one of the primary goals of the gathering is to “get our fighters excited” about the new posture of what was recently rebranded the Department of War.\nA White House official told CNN that the event is intended as a “show of force of what the new military now looks like” during Donald Trump’s second presidency.\n“It’s about getting the horses into the stable and whipping them into shape,” the military official familiar with the planning told CNN. “And the guys with the stars on their shoulders make for a better audience from an optics standpoint. This is a showcase for Hegseth to tell them: get on board, or potentially have your career shortened.”\nHegseth’s team reportedly plans to record and publicly release the address later, according to CNN, which cited three of its sources.\nA Pentagon spokesperson confirmed the upcoming gathering to the Guardian, saying that Hegseth “will meet with his senior military leaders”, but did not provide any further details.\nAccording to the Times, the Pentagon informed congressional committees overseeing the military on Friday that Hegseth intends to use the gathering to share with “most senior service members his intent for the department”, including new guidance on “military fitness standards and several other areas of interest”.\nSources cited by the Post say that Tuesday’s address will be the first of three short lectures by Hegseth. The second, the Post reported, will reportedly focus on the defense industrial base, and the third on deterrence.\nThe meeting has reportedly stirred unease and anxiety among some military officers, especially given Hegseth’s efforts to reshape the Pentagon and his recent firings of several senior officers.\nIn May, he ordered a 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals across the military and a 10% cut in the number of flag and general officers. And in recent months, he has dismissed more than a dozen senior military officials, according to the Times.\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\nafter newsletter promotion\nIn an interview on Thursday on MSNBC, retired army Lt Gen Mark Hertling described Tuesday’s planned gathering as highly unusual, adding that it was something he had “never seen before”.\n“There are a couple of reasons why he might be calling this meeting,” Hertling said. “It could be about a shifting national security strategy, or cuts to the general officer corps, which is something he has talked about several times – he’s floated it, to shrink the number of flag officers in the military. It could be a preparation for a potential budget stalemate next week, or it could be concerns over information leaks.”\n“Secretary Hegseth has fired 12 senior ranking general officers, so he could be firing more,” Hertling added. “Or is it performative theatre?”\nIn a post on social media on Friday, Lt Gen Ben Hodges of the army compared Tuesday’s gathering to a 1935 “surprise assembly in Berlin” where German generals were “required to swear a personal oath to the Führer”, Adolf Hitler, in the lead-up to the Holocaust and the second world war.\nHegseth, a former army national guard officer and ex-Fox News host, responded to Hodges by writing: “Cool story, General.”"

    "body": "Unflappable. Fair. A mentor. The trailblazing journalist Belva Davis carried all of these traits, according to friends and colleagues, as they remembered the first Black woman hired as a television reporter on the west coast in the days following her death.\nDavis entered television news in the 1960s, when the industry was dominated by white men, making her presence on screens especially pioneering. She died on Wednesday at the age of 92.\nDavis, the oldest of four siblings, was born in Monroe, Louisiana, in the middle of the Great Depression and the Jim Crow era. Her mother was only 14 when she gave birth, Davis wrote in her memoir Never in My Wildest Dreams: A Black Woman’s Life in Journalism.\n“Apparently if I was going to be lucky in life, I would have to be patient,” Davis wrote.\nHer family moved to the East Bay in California when she was a child, becoming a “tiny part of the so-called Second Great Migration west during World War II”, she wrote.\nWithout a college degree, Davis landed jobs at KPIX-TV, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, KRON and KQED, where she became a trusted figure as host of KQED Newsroom and This Week in Northern California. She retired in 2012.\n“Belva’s passing is a great loss for the Bay Area and KQED,” said Michael Isip, president and CEO of KQED, Northern California’s PBS member television station and public radio station. “For a half a century she covered the region’s most indelible stories with courage, integrity, grace and humanity. Along the way she fearlessly broke down barriers and opened doors for a generation of reporters.”\nCarla Marinucci, a longtime political reporter in California who appeared regularly on Davis’s show This Week in Northern California, described Davis as a mentor and trailblazer who broke barriers for both Black and women journalists.\n“She took many of us under her wing. An entire generation of us, myself included, have Belva to thank for breaking down barriers and for giving us a hand,” Marinucci said. “She had to jump countless hurdles as a Black woman to fight for every toehold in the field.”\nHer reporting spanned some of the most important moments in the Bay Area, and the country, at the time, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the Aids crisis, while also covering a hefty amount of local and national elections. She interviewed some of the most iconic figures of her time, including Muhammad Ali, Coretta Scott King, Fidel Castro, and later Kamala Harris, according to KQED.\nBarbara Lee, Oakland’s mayor, said she met Davis during her college years, and that she ended up being a “steady source of inspiration, guidance, and friendship”.\n“For Black women and people of color working to break into media and television, Belva was a beacon,” Lee said in a statement. “She opened doors that had long been closed, proving through her talent and perseverance that our voices belonged on the airwaves. She made it possible for a new generation of journalists to see themselves in all forms of media and to know they had a place in shaping public conversation.”\nDavis was married to Bill Moore, one of the country’s first Black television news cameramen. She had two children from her first marriage, Darolyn Davis and Steven Davis.\n“I will never forget traveling to Italy for her wedding anniversary, where friends and family from across the world gathered to honor the remarkable bond between Belva and Bill,” Lee said. “That celebration reflected the strength, joy, and grace she carried into every part of her life.”\nDavis began her journalism career in the 1950s, freelancing for Jet and Ebony magazines. As a Black woman, she faced sexism and overt racism throughout her career. In 1964, while covering the Republican National Convention at the Cow Palace, she was confronted with racial slurs, but she remained steady in her duty to report.\n“I could feel the hair rising on the back of my neck as I looked into faces turned scarlet and sweaty by heat and hostility,” she recalled in her memoir.\nScott Shafer, a reporter with KQED, remembered working closely with her during his time in City Hall in the 1980s, describing her as the kind of reporter people genuinely wanted to talk to.\n“Belva was unflappable,” Shafer said. “She was always very down-to-earth, kind and generous,” said Scott.\nFrom a young age, the harsh realities of racism, along with stories of Black Americans reported by other journalists, inspired her to document the experiences of a country contending with intense racial segregation.\n“I wanted to be one of them. I wanted to broadcast the reality of my community to those who could not otherwise imagine it, to fill in that missing perspective,” Davis wrote in her memoir.\nAnd so she did. Davis ended up winning eight regional Emmy Awards and earned lifetime achievement honors from the National Association of Black Journalists and American Women in Radio and Television."

    "body": "Grand finals shouldn’t end like this, with a party masquerading as a football match for half an hour or more. This was supposed to be a tight contest with the AFL’s two best teams, slugging it out in an arm wrestle for the title of the modern era’s best club, a fitting struggle for the final Saturday in September.\nBut as the Lions kept coming in a staggering second half, there was not just one defining grand final moment. Rather, they came thick and fast, too quickly to fully appreciate. A hallucination of glory, an incomprehensible haze.\nThere was Will Aschroft with a minute left, holding the ball up with a hand on the right wing, like a conductor with a baton triggering the maroon mass to roar. There was Logan Morris, who ambled with the ball over the boundary line in the forward pocket, before he became absorbed by the Brisbane fans on the fence. They hugged him, patted his head, and didn’t let him go for several seconds. With the lead more than 50, he could have lingered longer.\nGeelong’s Ollie Dempsey bagged a couple of consolation goals, but even those moments belonged to the Lions. Cats tormentor-in-chief Dayne Zorko turned around after one with his arms out facing the cheer squad, and the crowd came alive again. Thirty metres away Harris Andrews – normally a diplomat – was in a shoving match with Bailey Smith without a headband, Samson in defeat.\nAfter Hugh McCluggage eased another fourth-quarter goal through the sticks, Lachie Neale, Darcy Wilmot and half a dozen teammates piled on top. Zorko was last there, misjudging his entry – possibly for the only time all afternoon – and finishing upside down. This was a cake layered thick with icing, Zorko its cherry on top.\nThe scenes were harder to fathom given what had preceded them. Never has a first half been closer, the score of 36 apiece a fitting summary of the tussle the fans had been promised. Just as one team seemed to get away, the other one would come surging back. The two contenders that had been circling each other for much of the post-pandemic era appeared joined by an elastic band.\nThe second quarter opened with the Cats in the ascendancy, bombarding their opponents’ inside 50. Their lead of 10 was the largest in the first half. But first Morris and then Charlie Cameron, with a bender from the pocket, evened the ledger.\nAt that stage, every score seemed significant. Shannon Neale bombed one in from 60 then leant back and screamed. His back arched, his brow furrowed and his fangs were exposed. In the mid-afternoon sun he looked like a vampire at midnight.\nUndead? No, that was the Lions, whose teenage sensation Levi Ashcroft left Jhye Clark spellbound to send one home from 50m. Or was it the Cats’ Lawson Humphries, who silently materialised to feed Brad Close for another goal that brought scores level. At half-time, so too were the disposals, at 165. Kicks and handballs were identical. The Cats might have had the inside 50 count by one, but the Lions led in clearances by the same.\nSign up to Australia Sport\nGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk\nafter newsletter promotion\nThese two titans made this contest a stalemate for the first hour, yet the board tipped with two seismic events on either side of half-time. Geelong spearhead Jeremy Cameron suffered his forearm injury in a collision with Patrick Dangerfield just before the break, and the introduction of Lachie Neale gave the Brisbane midfield the ascendancy.\nWatching the Cat wince and grimace for the rest of the contest was a shame, as the game’s grandest stage was robbed of its finest goalkicker. Despite painkillers, padding, and increasing strapping tape from wrist to elbow, Cameron was clearly inhibited. Yet his diving grab on Jaspa Fletcher with his one good arm might have been the image of the match had the Cats somehow manufactured a victory.\nIt was reduced to a footnote, however, by Neale and co. The co-captain’s decisive third-quarter goal broke Geelong’s resistance, a gap through which celebrations flowed. He had announced three weeks ago his season was done. But on the podium holding the cup aloft the 32-year-old now stood, the catalyst in a barely imaginable footballing fantasy.\nAn hour after the siren, the Lions returned to the MCG turf to sing a song and sip beer under premiership caps. The crowd had gone, but the confetti remained, a reminder the Lions’ glorious afternoon was not a dream."

    "body": "I’ve always been fascinated by your fingernails, but I had no idea you do them yourself. Tell us about your nail regime.\nI started doing my nails about 25 years ago. Once I started touring so much, I couldn’t go back into a salon so I do it myself. It is a fast-drying gel. I’m usually really, really on to doing them because they’re so important – I can’t play guitar in my style without them.\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nThey have come off before, when they’re a bit old. I’ve ripped them off by accident when I’ve slipped or picked up something heavy. The first time it happened, I had to have a prosthetic nail for a while – I was touring so hard that my fake nail was lifting up the nail bed. It didn’t hurt because it happened so slowly, but I was taping it down. My prosthetic nail was a finger pick flipped around and attached with electrical tape on to the tip of my finger. I had to do that for a couple months. But for the most part, my nails are really healthy. I can’t believe I’m talking nail hygiene. [laughs] I’m quite techie on it.\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you have ever received?\n“You are your word in action.” That’s something I’ve learned by doing lots of men’s work – they are gatherings where men try to sort their shit out, [instead of] outsourcing that work. There was a lot of talk about how talking means nothing without being congruent. When you do what you say, and you say what you do – that’s an extremely important attribute to have as a human.\nThere’s a great project called the ManKind Project that is all about the reclamation of the male archetype out of the patriarchy. We are lovers and warriors, but we’re also nurturers and carers. And the toxicness that we see around the world is because of the patriarchy. I think a lot of people think “down with the patriarchy” means “down with guys”. But this system we have doesn’t really favour a man who is ultra-sensitive. We’re beaten into a certain shape, and that shape can make us toxic in the world. We’re meant to be partners and companions and fathers and lovers – not just workers and soldiers and CEOs.\nDo you ever miss your hair?\nIt’s right here! Do you mean my dreadlocks? No, not at all! I had dreadlocks for like 13 years. Do anything for 13 years, you’ve usually had enough of it.\nYour performances of your instrumental song Ocean have been viewed millions of times online. Every single version is a bit different – how has it evolved over the years?\nIt is like a really personal workout regime – sometimes I’ll run for 10 minutes and then do 50 push-ups, and sometimes I run for 20 minutes and only do five push-ups. Ocean is kind of the same. How it sounds depends on how I feel. If something sounds really cool, I might do it twice. There’s room for good improvisation or a happy accident – a lot of us musicians live for happy accidents. I add to it every time I play it – and so the song goes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes.\nIf I don’t play that song in every set, the spell doesn’t happen with the audience. It’s a strange thing – I can be doing it alright and then I’ll play Ocean, and then the whole crowd is like, “Oh, that’s what this is!”\nWhat’s been your most memorable interaction with a fan?\nI’ve had a lot of good ones! But this 11-year-old kid in Paris wrote me these lovely handwritten letters and asked to meet. He had learned Ocean probably better than anybody I have seen – and I’ve met a lot of people who’ve learned Ocean for their music exams, which has been so cool. But he played it perfectly. I was like, “Bro, what is going on with you?” He could do all the little idiosyncratic things that I did. He’s such a sweetheart – I’ve seen him since, he is an adult now. Sometimes he helps my crew at gigs because he wants to be a sound engineer. His name is Julian.\nWhat book, album or film do you always return to, and why?\nThere is a book called Over the Range by Ion Idriess – it’s an account of a journalist who goes out on a patrol throughout northern Kimberley to investigate some murders. It’s a snapshot of 1920s-1930s northern Australia, it is like a whole other world.\nAnd I always seem to go back to the Christopher Nolan Batmans. I’m not into the Marvel shit at all, but Christopher Nolan’s Batman is so well done. I really just love his aesthetic. Christian Bale is a great actor. So is Heath Ledger. That is my guilty indulgence. Part of me goes, “John, you’ve watched this so many times. Learn a language!” Nah, I want to watch Batman Begins.\nSign up to Saved for Later\nCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips\nafter newsletter promotion\nWhat’s the strangest job you’ve ever had?\nWell, there’s been paid work and unpaid work. Unpaid work is always weird. Emptying my compostable toilet when I lived in Mullumbimby, that was a nice, dirty, skanky job. And I once shaved a man’s back at a Super Bowl party in California. My older brother’s friend was like, “Hey before we go out, can you shave my back?” Like, I guess? I don’t even know you!\nAs for paid jobs, I did a lot of fruit picking after high school. I also did stained glass when I moved to California for a year after high school, for $5 an hour. Two hundred bucks for 40 hours a week. Yeah baby! That’s wild.\nDo you have a nemesis?\nOh me. I’m my greatest enemy. I don’t hate myself – I just find that the person I say the worst things about happens to be me. Which is kind of sad.\nWhat is the weirdest thing you’ve done for love?\nI’ve done so many crazy things for love, and all worth it. But I’ll change the sheet on my wife’s bed. I don’t give a fuck about it but she loves it. My love language is words of affirmation, but hers is acts of service. Some people see love when someone says, “Oh, I thought of you today”, or “I knew that you had a meeting tomorrow, so I printed out everything you needed”, or “I’ve made you a cup of coffee and the kitchen’s clean because I know you can think better when it is clean”. My wife’s love language is that. So I’ll often change the sheets before she gets back from tour. She loves it, and I just find it strange. It is so funny how people receive love in different ways.\nWhat is the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened to you on stage?\nThere was a fan in Antwerp who was bothering me all night. He was really drunk and being loud and intense right in front of me. I came up to the quietest song in the set, and he was singing along like we were soccer lads at a Manchester football club. For the whole song he was literally on my shit. I’m just surviving this guy and people in the audience were like, what’s happening? So the song ends on three beats – boom, boom, boom – and on the last boom I literally grabbed his face. My hand wrapped around his face like some alien and I led him off stage by his face. He was so shocked!\nJohn Butler is touring Australia 30 September to 5 October, then the UK and Europe for the rest of the year; see here for dates.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/27/beef-and-cattle-prices-record-highs",
    "body": "If beef is what’s for dinner, expect to pay more for it.\nThe classic combination of tight supply and strong demand has pushed US cattle and beef prices to record highs, and there is little end in sight with farmers reluctant to expand their herds and selling off high-priced heifers to dig them out of debt.\nGround beef prices hit a record high of $6.32 a pound in August, and beef prices were up 13.9% year-over-year according to the consumer price index, far outstripping overall inflation rise of 2.9%.\nMeanwhile, a culmination of years of low prices, rising costs to raise cattle, and years-long droughts that dried up grazing pasture caused cattle ranchers to slash their beef herds to the lowest level since 1951. As a result, CME Group live cattle futures prices recently rose to a high of $243.58 per hundredweight. (Hundredweight is equivalent to $10 per 100lbs)\nThere are several reasons for ranchers’ hesitancy, says David Anderson, livestock specialist at Texas A&M University. The last time cattle prices set a record in 2014, ranchers quickly bred more bovines, only to see prices collapse. Now he estimates cattle ranchers are making well-over $500 per head selling cattle and so far show little incentive to expand their herds.\nAfter several years of losing money, ranchers are grateful for the higher returns but many are gun shy to rebuild.\nBrett Kenzy, a fourth-generation cattle rancher in South Dakota, who raises 2,700 head of cattle, isn’t planning to expand. “We have much better prices, but I see a real lack of confidence in the market,” he says.\nNarciso Perez, founder of Zia Commodities, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, raises cattle and is a cattle broker, echoes Kenzy’s sentiments. Instead of spurring ranchers to breed heifers, high prices are incentivizing producers to sell them to pay debts.\n“It’s a matter of, I don’t know how long this is going to last, but I know that today I can pay all my bills off, and I know for two decades I’ve not been able to do that,” he says.\nEven if ranchers decided to start expanding the herd today, it could take up to four years to produce slaughter-ready cattle. “Biology is tough to beat,” Anderson says.\nBeef production has dipped further recently because the US closed the Mexican border to cattle imports to prevent the spread of New World screwworm, a species of flesh-eating fly larvae. With domestic supplies tight, it has a ripple effect on the national beef price, he says.\nThe cattle shortage is eating into the profits of major meat processors including Tyson, JBS and Cargill which all have reported lower earnings this year.\nConsumer preferences play their part in higher prices. Beef demand has grown over the years, but Americans eat fewer roasts and more ground beef and steaks, says Bryan Flannery, owner of Flannery Beef, a San Francisco-area boutique meat processor and distributor to wholesale and retail buyers, who has seen his costs rise.\nAdditionally, meat-eaters have gravitated to higher quality grades with more intra-muscular fat, such as upper choice and prime, which costs more than the leaner select grade. Because of this, grocery stores carry less of the cheaper select-grade beef, and ground beef contains more muscle meat than beef trimmings.\nLast year the US imported 16% of its beef needs, and tariffs will make your next burger more costly. Fifty percent of US beef consumption is ground beef, and Brazil is the biggest supplier of beef trimmings. The additional 50% tariff on Brazil imports means the total tax on those beef imports is 76.4%.\nRestaurant owners say they’ve seen their beef costs rise significantly and have no choice but to pass the costs on to consumers to stay in business. Leonard Botello, pitmaster and owner of craft barebcue restaurant Truth BBQ in Houston and Brenham in Texas, says when he opened 10 years ago, he paid $2.50 a pound for prime brisket and now pays about $8 a pound. He’s nearly doubled the price he charges diners for brisket to $37 a pound from $18 when he started.\nJason Vincent, owner of three popular Chicago restaurants, Giant, Chef’s Special and Pizza Matta, says his beef costs rose by $3 a pound in the past two months.\n“You want to offer value, but, honestly, that’s out the window. I mean, we’ve absorbed everything we can,” Vincent says.\nDespite having to raise prices, both Botello and Vincent say diners are undeterred as beef dishes are their biggest sellers. “Brisket is our highest seller, but lowest margin. The only way to make up for it is to sell a ton of brisket,” Botello says.\nFlannery, who sells dry-aged premium beef to high-end restaurants, says to make their margins, chefs generally need to mark up protein by three to four times what they purchase from him. “If I sell a steak that costs $25, they’re going to put that on the menu for $75 to $100,” he says.\nWith alcohol consumption down in restaurants, there’s less wiggle room on costs. “In the old days, they could say, Okay, I’ll back off on my margins on the protein, because I’m going to sell $100 bottle of wine,” he says.\nSo far there’s little sign of Americans eating less beef despite the high prices, but that’s the biggest worry, since beef prices have increased much more than pork or chicken. That’s what worries producers like Kenzy and Perez.\n“Demand destruction is the biggest risk,” Anderson says. “There’s not much evidence yet. But (consumers’) income is a concern, because if we were to go into a big recession, that matters a lot.”"

    "body": "The two Group One juvenile events here on Saturday were won by two-year-olds that promise to add to their haul of top-level races at three, but perhaps the strongest portent of the 2026 season came in the opening race, as Bow Echo extended his unbeaten record to three races in the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes.\nBow Echo is a solid 12-1 chance for next season’s 2,000 Guineas on 2 May – the Classic could be his next race – but it was the confident, perma-smiling presence of Billy Loughnane in his saddle that could become a motif for next summer.\nThis season has been another big step forward for Loughnane, who is six months away from his 20th birthday and did not ride a horse in public until the tail end of 2022. He notched his first Group One winner in mid-August on the Godolphin-owned Rebel’s Romance.

    "body": "A Scottish Labour MSP has been suspended from the party over an allegation of inappropriate conduct.\nFoysol Choudhury, who has served as an MSP for Lothian since 2021, will sit as an independent while the party carries out an investigation.\nA Labour spokesperson said the party “takes all complaints seriously”. “They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken,” they added.\nIt is understood that Choudhury was “administratively suspended” after the allegation.\nLast month the Scottish Labour MSP Colin Smyth was suspended, arrested and charged over the possession of indecent images. The week after Smyth’s suspension was announced, he was also charged over allegations a secret camera was placed in toilets inside the Scottish parliament – which he denies.\nThe two MSPs’ suspensions are not believed to be linked. The Guardian has contacted Choudhury for a comment.\nAfter Choudhury’s suspension, the SNP MP Kirsty Blackman called on the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, to “urgently come clean on the reasons why yet another Labour party MSP has been suspended”.\n“The public deserve full transparency,” she said. “Whatever the explanation, with yet another scandal on the eve of their party conference, there’s no doubt the Labour party is in crisis.”\nThe Scottish Conservative deputy leader, Rachael Hamilton, said Choudhury’s suspension showed “Labour are in complete chaos on the eve of their conference”.\nThe Tory MSP said: “Confidence in Sir Keir Starmer is gone after a year of broken promises and U-turns, the digital ID scheme has faced instant backlash, Anas Sarwar is engaging in bizarre attacks on independent experts, and now Scottish Labour have had to suspend another MSP.”\nHamilton added that Labour should be “as transparent as possible about what has happened”.\nChoudhury is chair of the Edinburgh and Lothians Regional Equality Council. He was also one of the founding directors of the annual multicultural festival Edinburgh Mela, where he serves as vice-chair."

    "body": "The timing of the news left a sour taste in the mouth. Graham Potter has been in trouble for more than a month. There was no decision after West Ham continued their dreadful start to the season last Saturday, losing 2-1 to Crystal Palace at a deflated London Stadium, and it seemed Potter had been given one last chance to save his job given that he conducted his usual media duties before facing Everton on Monday night.\nThere was defiance from the 50-year-old on Friday night. Blame the coach all you like, Potter said, but it is worth looking at the wider context. “You have to look at where the club was at,” he said. “Because then you can make an assessment of how long it needs to turn results around. What was the environment like? What was the culture like? What was the team like?”\nAnswer: toxic, dysfunctional, slow.\nWest Ham were not in a good place when Potter replaced Julen Lopetegui in January. Tim Steidten, the outgoing technical director, had wasted so much money. Those who worked around Steidten believe not enough is made of how much damage was left by the German’s recruitment. They can see the wider picture. They accept Potter did not do well enough before his time was up on Saturday morning, but one club source says the task of reviving West Ham could not have been harder for the former Chelsea manager.\nSo the question was always whether David Sullivan, the man who calls the shots at West Ham, would stick with Potter. The feeling was that Sullivan, whose conduct around this sacking has left insiders and external figures distinctly unimpressed, liked Potter and wanted it to work.\nNot enough, though, to hold his nerve once it became clear that West Ham’s Premier League status was very much in doubt. Potter has had eight months. He argued on Friday that it was not long enough to build a team in his image but he forgot that there is no such thing as patience at West Ham. There is merely dysfunction dressed up as loyalty. There is no belief in anything beyond survival, no identity.\nPotter, who won six of his 25 games in charge, is a careful, long-term strategist. He underwhelmed after arriving midway through last season and needed to start this campaign well. The mood music was always going to change after West Ham lost four of their first five league games and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Wolves.\nThere are always agents in Sullivan’s ear, pushing the 76-year-old to act. The writing was on the wall when it emerged that West Ham had met Nuno Espírito Santo before the Palace game, diminishing Potter’s authority. Even then, though, there was no call from Sullivan. The suggestion was that Nuno was too expensive and had issues relating to his recent exit from Nottingham Forest to clear up. Slaven Bilic, the former West Ham manager, was pushed as an alternative on an interim basis.\nNow there is disgust that Potter was sent out to speak to the media. Why not relieve him of his duties after losing to Palace? Why let him make irrelevant preparations for Everton? How is this the way to behave? It is more reactiveness, more short-termism, more grubbiness. The talks with Nuno were continuing. With the final obstacles with Nuno cleared on Friday night, Potter was brought in on Saturday morning and sacked.\nNuno will be in charge against Everton, hoping for an immediate impact after a couple of days with his new players. For Potter, the hope will be that he is not too damaged by his brief spell at West Ham. On Friday he talked about making gradual progress at Brighton, who are the polar opposite to West Ham. Brighton were fourth when they lost Potter to Chelsea. There are proper structures in place at Brighton. Managers get time to grow. West Ham, by contrast, lurch from one panicky crisis to the next. Potter’s great mistake was to think he could build while the fire was raging around him.\nHe brought in a psychologist in the summer in an attempt to change a “low-trust culture” in the dressing room. He never hammered his players in public, even when they failed to perform basic tasks such as marking and running. Yet last summer’s recruitment was confused.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nWest Ham lack leadership across the board and dynamism in midfield. It beggared belief that their first moves were to sign a left-back, the inexperienced El Hadji Malick Diouf from Slavia Prague, and a ball-playing goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, for £15m from Leicester. Straightforward deals for midfielders who could have lifted the level were ignored. Unrealistic targets were pursued.\nPotter was said to have been obsessed with trying to sign Jacob Ramsey, who ended up leaving Aston Villa for Newcastle. It was absurd that it took until the end of August for West Ham to bolster their midfield – even then, though, they went for more inexperience, the 21-year-old duo of Mateus Fernandes joining from Southampton and Soungoutou Magassa from Monaco.\nIt led to Sullivan growing dissatisfied with Kyle Macaulay, the head of recruitment. But here comes another flaw. Macaulay, who joined from Chelsea and replaced Steidten, was linked to Potter and is expected to leave. It means that the decision to sack Potter and bring in Nuno has not been made by a director of football, but by Sullivan.\nOne well-placed figure says West Ham’s structure is totally outdated. It is all about Sullivan’s whims. All about his mood. There is no oversight. Other board members have no real power. Every major move comes from one man. There is no respect for expertise. No understanding of how to appoint top-level executives. It has been this way for 15 years. No wonder West Ham look lumpen next to Brighton, Brentford and Bournemouth.\nMacaulay is the third consecutive recruitment figure linked to the manager (Manuel Pellegrini had Mario Husillos, David Moyes had Rob Newman). It is an illogical way to do business. Was Macaulay going to challenge Potter? Recommend his sacking? Push him to make a decision on a player? But then Macaulay’s power always had limits. Everything was a battle. In an ideal world Potter would not have been forced into the compromise of signing the ageing former Newcastle striker Callum Wilson on a free transfer.\nNuno inherits a poor, unbalanced squad. Equally, though, it cannot be argued that Potter did a good job. West Ham have conceded 13 goals in five games, attack with no set patterns and have been hopeless at defensive set pieces. It is understood some players had doubts over Potter’s tactics.\nPerhaps it is positive West Ham have acted before it is too late. Nuno’s stock is high after leading Nottingham Forest into Europe. He will look to make West Ham hard to beat. Nuno plays on the counterattack. He will look to stiffen his defence, use the pace of Crysencio Summerville and Jarrod Bowen on the flanks and tap into the creativity of Lucas Paquetá and Fernandes.\nWest Ham need a pragmatist. The chaos means they need someone who can put out fires. There is no vision. Nuno is West Ham’s fourth manager in 16 months. The counterpunching Moyes was followed by the Basque approach of Lopetegui, who was replaced by the possession-heavy football of Potter, who has made way for the possession-lite Nuno.\nThe squad is not built for anyone in particular. Nuno must go in with his eyes open. The thinking behind his appointment seems to be that he is available, known and recently impressed at another Premier League club. For Nuno, though, there is risk. He has left Evangelos Marinakis and decided to work for Sullivan, swapping one overbearing owner for another. “Good luck to him,” one source said. “I hope he knows what he’s walking into.”"

    "body": "Neo-Nazi murderer and bomber Pavlo Lapshyn did not get to serve out the 40-year term of his sentence. He was found dead in his cell at Wakefield prison on Tuesday, 12 years after being jailed. The circumstances of his death have not yet been publicly confirmed.\nThe Ukrainian national was 37. He was convicted at the Old Bailey in October 2013 of murdering Muslim man Mohammed Saleem, 82, in April of that year.\nSaleem was a pillar of the local community who was on his way home from evening prayers at the mosque when Lapshyn stabbed him three times in the back and stamped on his head.\nLapshyn later planted three bombs outside mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton. Along with Saleem’s murder, he was convicted of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life and of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He is not known to have expressed any remorse.\nA picture found on his computer by police had words and images relating to the murder, with a smiley face and the slogan “WHITE POWER”.\nSaleem’s daughter, Maz Saleem, the youngest of seven children, has said she forgives Lapshyn for taking her father’s life in such a brutal and horrific way. At a time where hatred and division are increasing hers is a rare voice calling for calm and healing.\n“In the early days after his murder, I wanted revenge,” she says. “I wanted the pain I felt to be felt by the man who killed him. Over time I realised that living in anger would consume me and give the far right even more power over my life.\n“I’ve recently come to a place of forgiveness as carrying hate in my heart doesn’t help. I’m a very empathetic person and I’m actually feeling for his parents at this time. Parents are parents, aren’t they, and his are very elderly.”\nShe has spent years campaigning against racism and Islamophobia and does not want the murder of her father to continue the cycle of hatred between people from different backgrounds.\n“I miss my father every day. Pavlo Lapshyn butchered him outside our house, where we used to walk five times a day, every day.\n“When I heard that he had died in prison, my first reaction was not joy but reflection. I have lived with the consequences of his actions for more than a decade. I have known anger so deep it kept me awake at night. But I have also spent these years deciding not to let hatred dictate my future.\n“For me, it’s time to forgive, because we need a world of unity. I wish him to rest in peace, and I am keeping his parents in my thoughts.”\nShe was notified of Lapshyn’s death in a brief letter from the Ministry of Justice, stating: “I am writing to inform you that PL has died in custody. As a consequence the involvement of the victim liaison officer in this case has come to an end and our contact with you will cease.”\nThe Prison Service said: “This was an abhorrent crime and our thoughts remain with Mr Saleem’s friends and family.”\nMaz emphasises that forgiving Lapshyn does not mean she condones what he did.\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\n“His actions were gravely wrong and he caused immense pain. But I believe holding on to hatred serves no one. What Pavlo Lapshyn stood for – hatred, extremism and racism – is the opposite of everything our community believes in, and we must continue to stand for forgiveness, justice and peace. I refuse to allow hatred to poison my heart.”\nShe is alarmed by the rise of anti-migrant and far-right campaigners: “The fact that we have 150,000 people marching on our streets holding these views is disturbing, very disturbing,” she says.\n“We are living in dangerous times. The murder of my father was not an isolated incident. Muslim women have been attacked on our streets, a Sikh woman was allegedly raped, a Bangladeshi boy was assaulted. The far right are emboldened.\n“Britain must take far-right violence as seriously as any other form of terrorism. That means protecting places of worship, resourcing counter-extremism programmes, educating young people, holding those who spread hate to account, and supporting victims’ families beyond the first weeks of tragedy.”\nShe says her much-loved father, who came to the UK in 1957, settled in the West Midlands, working first at a steelworks and then in a bakery, always told her that “education is key, knowledge is power”, and encouraged her to stand up for what is right.\n“More than 6,000 people came to his funeral because he had spent his life serving others – guiding young people away from crime, encouraging girls to pursue education, and bringing neighbours together.”\nShe says her decision to forgive Lapshyn has been greeted largely positively.\n“I have received overwhelming support and solidarity. Women have reached out to thank me, saying this is the lesson racists need to hear. To those who celebrate anyone’s death, I say: I understand the pain and anger, but we must not become what we despise.\n“My father’s story is not just a chapter in the history of far-right terror – it is a warning. His legacy must be more than grief. It must be a call to confront hate, build solidarity, and create a future where no one is targeted for how they look, how they worship, or where they come from. Forgiveness is my way of refusing to be defined by fascism – but my fight for justice is far from over.”"

    "body": "At least 300 students have been prohibited from registering for classes at Northwestern University because they refused to watch a controversial antisemitism training video that they said was biased in favor of Israel, contained factual inaccuracies and could inflame campus tension over Gaza.\nThe university’s decision puts jobs, visas, stipends and health insurance at risk, students said during a press conference in Chicago on Friday morning, but those who spoke said they were still unwilling to do the training.\n“The training is not just about silencing speech, but achieving consent so that we are complicit,” said Salma Moustafa, a PhD student in sociology. “Northwestern wants its student and faculty body to pretend it is not happening and instead consume propaganda that justifies the Israeli Zionist occupation project.”\nStudents were required to complete the training by mid-September to be able to register.\nA university spokesperson said in a statement that the training was similar to those that are required for discrimination or harassment. “As with other mandatory student trainings, failure to complete this training can result in university action, including a registration hold,” the spokesperson said.\n“Students are not required to agree with the training modules but must attest that they will abide by the student code of conduct, as well as the university’s policy on discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct,” they added.\nUniversities across the US are requiring students to undergo controversial antisemitism trainings in response to Trump administration threats to pull funding for institutions that, in its view, fail to adequately address campus antisemitism. It is not clear how many other universities are requiring student participation. The Northwestern training included a video on antisemitism and another on anti-Arab bias.\nStudents objecting to the video say it equates criticism of Israel with antisemitism. At one point the narrator compares critics of Israel to former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, and uses a controversial definition of antisemitism.\nThe video also states that Israel was founded “on British land” and refers to the occupied West Bank as “Judea and Samaria”, the biblical name controversially used for the region by the Israeli government.\nThe training module’s opponents at Northwestern, many of them Jewish, say the material does little to protect Jews. Instead, it “reinforces, rather than reduces, the proliferation of discriminatory bias in our communities”, students wrote in an open letter.\nThe Northwestern training was produced by the Jewish United Fund (JUF) , a pro-Israel advocacy group that Micol Bez, a student organizer, said has opposed a ceasefire. In a statement, the JUF defended the video.\n”There is a critical difference between criticizing policies of the state of Israel versus questioning Israel’s right to exist – and demonizing Jewish students for their connections to Israel,” a spokesperson said.\nThe university emailed students in March to say that the implementation of the training “will adhere to federal policy including President Donald Trump’s 29 January executive order, ‘Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism’”.\nDespite the university requiring students to undergo the training, the Trump administration still cut $790m in research funding."

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/sep/27/tony-harrison-poet-and-dramatist-dies-aged-88",
    "body": "Tony Harrison, the award-winning poet and dramatist whose writings fuelled national conversations about class, obscenity and politics, has died at the age of 88, his publisher has confirmed.\nHarrison, a major voice in British poetry since he published his first collection in 1964, wrote front-page dispatches for the Guardian from the Bosnian war, and scandalised the nation with his 1985 poem V. Written after football hooligans desecrated his parents’ gravestones, the expletive-laden work was described as a “torrent of filth” by the Daily Mail when it was broadcast on Channel 4, prompting an early-day motion in the Commons. It is now studied in schools.\nHarrison grew up in a working-class family in Leeds, winning a scholarship to Leeds grammar school and studying classics at the University of Leeds. His poetry explored the tension between his working-class background and the arts, from the teacher who mocks him in Them & [uz] – “You’re one of those / Shakespeare gives the comic bits to: prose!’” – to the resulting separation he felt from his parents due to his education. In the poem Book Ends, he wrote of how he felt unable to talk to his father on the night of his mother’s death: “Back in our silences and sullen looks, / for all the Scotch we drink, what’s still between’s / not the thirty or so years, but books, books, books.”\nIn 1962, his friendship with Nobel laureate and fellow Leeds graduate Wole Soyinka contributed to his moving to Nigeria, where he wrote the play Akin Mata, a version of Aristophanes’ comedy Lysistrata with African music and dance, and published his first poetry pamphlet, Earthworks, in 1964. Returning to Britain in 1967, his first collection The Loiners won him the Geoffrey Faber memorial prize in 1970.\nHis 1973 adaptation of Molière’s The Misanthrope was his big break at the National Theatre. Adaptations of The Oresteia and The Mysteries would follow, as did original productions Phaedra Britannica, Bow Down and The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, which was based on fragments of a Sophocles play. But though his career would span theatre, opera, film, television and print, Harrison preferred to be regarded as a poet. “I hate being called poet/dramatist/translator/director. Poet covers it all for me,” he told the Guardian in 2015, after winning the David Cohen prize. “I want to do justice to my inwardness, my tenderness, my political rage.” \nIn 1987, when Richard Eyre’s film of V was broadcast, Harrison became renowned as a public poet, and a fearlessly political one, making headlines again two years later for his film-poem The Blasphemers’ Banquet, which was prompted by the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie and led to the Archbishop of Canterbury asking the BBC to withdraw it. In his 1999 film-poem Prometheus, the story of the titan who stole fire from the gods to give to humans, Harrison reframed this act as an example of class warfare, with Yorkshire miners facing up to Zeus and Hermes, who are agents of capitalism.\nIn 1995, the Guardian sent him to Bosnia to cover the war. A poem written while travelling in an armoured vehicle outside Sarajevo made the paper’s front page. “Why shouldn’t poetry address what happened yesterday, and be published in the newspaper?” he told the Guardian 20 years later in a 2007 interview. “Yes, I’ve got inwardness and tenderness, but I also get angry and vituperative, and you have to honour that as well.” His 2003 poem Iraquatrains, published a month before the “dodgy dossier” scandal became public, urged readers to: “Go round to Downing St, get Tony Blair’s hard disc.”\nHarrison rejected establishment attempts to bestow accolades on him, calling honours “the nature of British life. It’s horrible.” When named as a possible contender for the poet laureateship in 1999, he made his feelings clear in a poem in the Guardian, titled Laureate’s Block. Harrison wanted, he wrote, to remain “free to write what I think should be written / free to scatter scorn in Number 10 / free to blast and bollock Blairite Britain”. He also took a swipe at the monarchy: “There should be no successor to Ted Hughes... / Nor should Prince Charles succeed our present queen / And spare us some toady’s ode on coronation.”\nThe current laureate, Simon Armitage, however, has spoken of how Harrison blazed a trail. “He has allowed my generation to do our own thing without having to worry too much about where we come from and what accents we’ve got,” said Armitage in 2000. “Trying to write in a way that’s representative of our voices was a pitched battle for him.”\nSpeaking in 2000, Harrison said that he hoped “the people who knew me will talk about me over a bottle of wine after I’ve gone”. “But what I’m proud of is that I can read poems about my parents in Leeds or Bradford, and men especially are suddenly sobbing in the audience. That a short poem has touched them that deeply and brings that kind of response is better than a rave review,” he said, going on to ruminate on his own inspiration.\n“I always feel, especially in my fallow periods, that I don’t recognise this monster who finishes my work with such intensity. It’s like Rumpelstiltskin coming in and turning all the straw into gold and then going away again. I’ve done poems for the page, the stage, the opera house, television, film and newspapers. It’s all one work. You know, maybe the life is really about dodging about to achieve moments where the work can happen. And often you fuck up your life in order to get that moment. But that’s the way it can be when the muses have your telephone number.”"

    "body": "Renee Slegers conceded her Arsenal team are already under pressure having dropped four points in their opening four WSL games after Lucy Parker’s late equaliser for Aston Villa. It was the second week in a row the Gunners have dropped points, following a goalless draw at Manchester United last Sunday.\n“We’ve lost four points and that’s not what we’ve wanted,” Slegers said. “We need to learn from this and learn very fast. We had more possession and solutions, but we didn’t have enough urgency in and around the box. When the game is 1-0 the opposition always believe they can get back in it.”\nIt was a frustrating afternoon for the home side in front of 24,712 fans and the point was just reward for a resilient Villa performance that was let down only by a defensive error for Frida Maanum’s early opener. Missy Bo Kearns’s short pass was intercepted by Mariona Caldentey and fed to the Norwegian for her to slot her shot past Sabrina D’Angelo.\nArsenal were worthy of the lead, dominating possession with Kim Little driving play from the middle, but they struggled to capitalise on that dominance, managing two shots on target in the first half despite 28 touches in the opposition area. Villa had a kinder return, one shot on target and four touches. That reflected the level of Arsenal supremac,y but Villa are not an easy side to play against, despite winning one point from their opening two games.\nArsenal experienced their strength in April at Villa Park, with the home side 3-0 up inside 46 minutes before going on to win 5-2. Natalia Arroyo expected “a little bit of revenge vibes” in their first meeting since that defeat, but after the break it was the Villa who looked sharper.\nEbony Salmon went closest in the 53rd minute, her effort slipping narrowly wide of the far post, while they failed to capitalise on a bursting run from substitute Kirsty Hanson.\nArsenal made changes in the 65th minute, Victoria Pelova and Caitlin Foord replacing Maanum and Olivia Smith, and their best change of doubling their lead in the second half came when the ball landed at Foord’s feet in the area , but her hesitation allowed Villa to nullify the danger. A fine save from D’Angelo denied Katie McCabe, while the goalkeeper got low to halt Pelova’s effort from the edge of the area as they sought to lift the pressure late on.\nVilla were still much in it though. “The most important thing is dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, trying, trying, trying to the end,” said Arroyo.\nSign up to Moving the Goalposts\nNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe sucker punch of an equaliser arrived after four minutes of added time, Lynn Wilms’s free-kick forcing a fingertip save from Daphne van Domselaar and Parker fired in the loose ball from the resulting corner, leaving the Gunners to regret their profligacy.\n“For some reason we didn’t perform at our highest level . Why that didn’t happen is something we’ll have to review,” said Slegers. “We need to stay level headed. We had 19 shots and that’s around where we want to be. We need to analyse it, but not over-analyse it.”"

    "body": "The holy grail continues to elude Ruben Amorim. Call it progress, consistency, momentum. Or just back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time. The manager had taken encouragement from last Saturday’s 2-1 home win over Chelsea, even if United had almost located their own feet with heavy gunfire in the closing stages.\nIt needed to be a platform. And yet, as so often, United followed one step forward with two in the opposite direction. The question beforehand had concerned which United would turn up because nobody can ever be sure, least of all Amorim.\nThey gave their answer during a laughably bad opening 25 minutes when they conceded two horror goals and were fortunate that the damage was not worse. Igor Thiago continued his positive start to the season for Brentford, scoring both of them, and, for United, the tone was set.\nThere was a first United goal for Benjamin Sesko in the 26th minute but his team pretty much went through the bingo card of frustrating stuff after that. Lack of conviction at the back. Lack of penetration in the final third. Errors all over the pitch. Check.\nThere was even a penalty miss by Bruno Fernandes on 76 minutes, his second in west London of the season, after the one he blazed into the Thames at Fulham. This time, after another long wait, Caoimhín Kelleher read his intentions and went the right way to save.\nAmorim finished with Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount on as substitutes. It was Mainoo alongside Fernandes in midfield, Bryan Mbeumo at right-wingback, Mount at leftwingback. It was total attack. And yet, predictably, it would end in a total mess as Brentford broke in stoppagetime and the substitute Mathias Jensen flashed a shot from outside the box through the hands of Altay Bayindir.\nNathan Collins was behind Bryan Mbeumo and pulled him back. Craig Pawson awarded a penalty but Collins was only booked. The challenge was looked at by the video assistant referee but he did not recommend a review.\n\nLaw 12 says: \n\nWhere a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.\n\nIt continues:\n\nThe following must be considered: \ndistance between the offence and the goal\ngeneral direction of the play\nlikelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball\n\nThe Premier League match centre said on social media that Mbeumo was deemed not to be in control of the ball.\nFor Keith Andrews, it was another good home result; the statement victory of his Brentford tenure so far. For Amorim, the numbers in the league are probably worth printing: W9 D7 L17.\nAmorim had called for an aggressive start. Actually, he had begged for one. Instead, United were pedestrian. They were loose. And they felt the early body blow. The finish from Thiago was quite something. He allowed Jordan Henderson’s long ball to bounce, set himself with a little header that was slightly away from goal and then lashed a rising drive into the near top corner.\nThe major detail of the breakthrough was that Thiago had pretty much the entire United half into which to run. Matheus Cunha had looked for a cheap free-kick at the other end that was not there and when Henderson launched the pass, Harry Maguire rushed up to play Thiago offside, only he was too slow. It almost goes without saying that Maguire was never going to make the yards back.\nWhere to start with the verdict on United during those first 25 minutes? It was just so bad with and without the ball – especially without it. Brentford had time and space. They worked their patterns. They threatened from set pieces, including Michael Kayode’s long throws.\nThe second concession was another disaster from a United point of view. It followed another long ball and more meekness, Matthijs de Ligt and Maguire both guilty. Thiago had helped it wide left for Kevin Schade, who was allowed to cross and Bayindir could only parry weakly at the feet of Thiago, who had continued his run in expectation of an error. It was a tap-in.\nUnited’s lifeline came out of nothing. Patrick Dorgu stretched to cross high from the byline and when Mbeumo, who was given a warm welcome back from the home crowd, leaned into Kelleher, the goalkeeper coughed it up to Sesko. It was a case of third time lucky for the United striker. Twice, Kelleher denied him at close quarters. He was powerless when the ball broke for Sesko again.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nA United fan called Frank Ilett pledged on 5 October last year not to cut his hair until his team had won five games in a row in all competitions. Their best streak has been the three in January, two of them in the Europa League. Ilett, now with something approaching a privet hedge atop his cranium, simply lives in hope.\nUnited’s lack of goals under Amorim has been chronic and there was an edge to the pleadings from their fans on the hour. “Attack, attack, attack,” they chanted. Where was the tempo? It was as though United were going through the motions.\nBrentford had chances to restore their two-goal cushion. Sepp van den Berg almost got to a Nathan Collins header in front of goal while Thiago was denied by an excellent Bayindir save.\nBrentford had structure in midfield. Henderson provided the assurance, Mikkel Damsgaard flitted in the No 10 role. Amorim went all out when he introduced Mainoo for the ineffective Manuel Ugarte. Now there was no defensive bone in the middle of the pitch for his team.\nUnited wanted a red card for Collins on the penalty because he did not look to have tried to play the ball when he pulled back Mbeumo. The referee, Craig Pawson, spared him. And when Fernandes missed the kick, United had that painfully familiar sinking feeling."

    "body": "West Ham have moved swiftly to hire Nuno Espírito Santo as manager after sacking Graham Potter two days before facing Everton. Potter was relieved of his duties after nine months in the job on Saturday.\nThe London club said in a statement: “West Ham United is delighted to announce the appointment of Nuno Espírito Santo as the club’s new men’s head coach. Nuno has signed a three-year contract with the Hammers and will take charge of his first match on Monday evening when we travel to Everton in the Premier League.\n“He arrives at London Stadium having put together a hugely impressive coaching career, most recently leading Nottingham Forest to European qualification via a seventh-place Premier League finish and the FA Cup semi-finals last season… the 51-year-old is among the most highly respected coaches in the modern game. Nuno brings his outstanding coaching ability, tactical acumen and leadership qualities to West Ham United and is looking forward to getting down to work in east London.”\n“I am very pleased to be here and very proud to be representing West Ham United,” Nuno said. “My objective is to work hard to get the very best from the team and ensure that we are as competitive as we possibly can be. The work has already started and I am looking forward to the challenge that is ahead.”\nThe new head coach took training at Rush Green on Saturday afternoon, West Ham said, adding that hewill be assisted in the interim by academy coaches Mark Robson, Steve Potts, Gerard Prenderville and Billy Lepine. “A further announcement on his coaching and backroom staff to be made in due course.”\nWest Ham’s next Premier League match is against Everton, who are making headway under the former Hammers manager David Moyes. Kyle Macaulay, West Ham’s head of recruitment and close to Potter, is expected leave.\nEarlier the club had said: “West Ham United can confirm that head coach Graham Potter has left the club. Results and performances over the course of the second half of last season and the start of the 2025-26 season have not matched expectations, and the board believe that a change is necessary in order to help improve the team’s position in the Premier League as soon as possible.\n“The club can confirm that assistant coach Bruno Saltor, first team coaches Billy Reid and Narcis Pelach, lead goalkeeper coach Casper Ankergren, and goalkeeper coach Linus Kandolin have also left with immediate effect.\n“The board would like to thank Graham and his coaching staff for their hard work during their time with the Hammers and wish them every success for the future. The process of appointing a replacement is under way.”\nThe move follows last Saturday’s 2-1 home defeat by Crystal Palace. West Ham lost 3-0 at promoted Sunderland on the opening weekend, then were routed 5-1 at home by Chelsea, despite Lucas Paquetá giving them the lead.\nWest Ham went out of the Carabao Cup at Wolves, the 3-2 defeat marked by a confrontation between Jarrod Bowen and a Hammers fan. After a 3-0 victory at Nottingham Forest, West Ham lost by the same scoreline at home to Spurs. Palace’s 2-1 victory at the London Stadium proved the final straw.\nDamningly, West Ham have lost their opening three home league games for the second consecutive season, the first time they have done so in 98 seasons in English football.\nPotter was appointed in January as successor to Julen Lopetegui. He enjoyed some successes – notably a 1-0 win at Arsenal that badly damaged the Gunners’ title hopes – but the Hammers were 14th when he took over and he could not improve on that position come the season’s end. Two of his five wins last season were against Ipswich and Leicester, who were relegated.\nPotter would have banked on a strong summer to kickstart his reign, but the departure of Mohammed Kudus to rivals Tottenham for £55m heightened fans’ frustration. The unrest of the supporters’ failed to ease after a flurry of signings during the final weeks of the transfer window coincided with the heavy defeats to Sunderland and Chelsea in August. Fan protests towards the club’s board have been a feature of home games in recent weeks.\nPotter acknowledged he was under scrutiny after the defeat by Chelsea, saying: “You are under pressure all the time in these jobs. In this situation, that is how it is. I know the territory, I know what comes with poor results and I accept that responsibility. It was too easy to score against us so I take my responsibility and I have to do better. That is the case with all the players.”\nAfter the Palace match, he said: “Do I believe I can turn it around? Of course. I also understand it’s tough. We’re in a tough situation, there’s no getting away from that. The only thing you can do is front it up, be honest with it. We want to do better than we are and at the moment we’re not.”\nThe 50-year-old, who made his name at Östersunds in Sweden, Swansea and then Brighton, had been out of management for more than a year and a half when he was appointed by West Ham. He had been sacked in April 2023 by Chelsea after less than a year in charge, with the club 11th in the Premier League.\nMore to follow"

    "body": "“Go woke, go broke” is a movie catchphrase du jour, loved by rightwing culture warriors, who take aim at mainstream films judged to have adopted progressive values, and therefore are worthy of boycott and complaints. Films as varied as The Marvels, Charlie’s Angels, Ghostbusters (the 2016 reboot) and Pixar’s Elio have been attacked for their perceived commitment to inclusiveness and diversity, and in some cases their box office revenue appears to have been affected as a result.\nBut is it actually the case? Film data analyst Stephen Follows, an adviser to Guinness World Records and author of The Horror Movie Report, has published research on how audiences actually respond to “woke-adjacent” content in current cinema. First presented at the Zurich film festival on Saturday, Follows’ research suggests that there is no blanket rule for the success or otherwise of progressive-themed mainstream cinema, and adds that for some genres – horror, sports and music films in particular – diverse casting and identity-driven stories can have a substantially positive effect on commercial success.\nConversely, however, Follows concludes that big-budget blockbusters face considerable risks if they indulge in “heavy-handed politics”, incurring a backlash if “audiences feel political messaging overrides story or character”. Moreover, weakening well-established characters or narratives – in films such as the James Bond series – carries what Follows describes as a “massive financial risk”. He claims: “Rewriting legacy canon or characters is one of the strongest negative signals for commercial performance.”\nFollows’ main tool for identifying audience reaction to themes and content – applied to around 4m publicly available comments – is text embedding, a machine-learning process that converts text into numerical values, which makes specific terms easier to identify. Follows then compared the strength of comments around individual ideas to profitability estimates to assess commercial impact.\nAfter analysing responses to more than 10,000 films, Follows concluded there was no consistent pattern to whether a film’s progressive themes harmed its box office. “Problems … are linked to execution,” he said. “Heavy-handed political messaging, clumsy canon changes, or anachronistic dialogue reduce audience satisfaction and profitability.”\nFollows added that “horror audiences, who are younger on average, are more open to reinvention and less resistant to changes”. Citing relatively recent films such as Candyman, the 2018 reboot of Halloween and Evil Dead Rise, he said: “Identity-driven perspectives, diverse casting, and reimagined canon often boost appeal by adding novelty and raising stakes.”\nIn sports and music categories, Follows suggests that a number of films, including Creed III, Rocketman and A Star Is Born, had their commercial performance strengthened by “identity narratives” and “inclusive themes”.\nThe biggest risks, however, are faced by long-running big-budget franchises such as James Bond, which is now being overhauled after being bought by Amazon MGM, with a new director and screenwriter (Denis Villeneuve and Steven Knight respectively). A search is also under way for a new lead actor after Daniel Craig’s retirement from the role.\nAccording to Follows, departing from “core canon” can carry serious financial consequences. “Audiences react poorly when identity-driven changes are seen as imposed rather than motivated by character or story. The risks multiply when several shifts occur at once. A change to Bond’s race, gender, or nationality on its own would already be financially risky, but stacking multiple changes compounds the danger.”\nHe adds: “[It] represents a high-stakes gamble with billions in potential revenue.”"

    "title": "Outrage mounts as Republicans in Congress move to protect pesticide makers from lawsuits",
    "section": "US news",
    "publication_date": "2025-09-27T13:00:44Z",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/republican-pesticide-legislation",
    "body": "It’s been seven years since Germany’s Bayer bought US agrochemical giant Monsanto, inheriting not only the company’s vast portfolio of seeds and pesticide products, but also more than 100,000 lawsuits alleging Monsanto’s popular Roundup herbicide causes cancer. Bayer, which has so far paid out billions of dollars in settlements and jury verdicts to cancer victims, has been working – so far in vain – to put an end to the litigation and to block any future such cases.\nNow Bayer appears closer than ever to success, as many Republican congressional leaders push for measures that would effectively block lawsuits against pesticide makers around the country.\nA group founded by Bayer called the Modern Ag Alliance is the face of the legislative push, advocating for liability shields they say are necessary to allow companies to continue to sell chemicals that farmers use to kill weeds and bugs in their fields.\n“Without legislative action, a potential catastrophe is on the horizon that could result in many farmers going out of business and food prices rising even further,” the alliance, which represents more than 100 agricultural organizations, including farmers who grow wheat, corn, soybeans and other key food crops, warns on its website.\nThe alliance has been lobbying for the passage of state laws blocking such lawsuits. They’ve succeeded thus far in two states – Georgia and North Dakota – and continue to lobby for such laws in all 50 states.\nBut the immediate battleground is in the halls of Congress, where a provision tucked into a congressional appropriations bill is outraging consumer advocates, including those affiliated with the influential Make American Healthy Again (Maha) movement. Similar protective language for pesticide makers is expected to be included in the new farm bill as well.\n“The audacity of elected officials voting for legislation to fully strip our legal rights away when injured by chemicals is stunning,” said Kelly Ryerson, a leading Maha advocate who has been lobbying lawmakers and her 84,000 social media followers to oppose pesticide company protections. “Especially in this age of Maha when an unprecedented number of Americans are rallying against toxins in food and the environment.”\nBayer has made it clear that changing laws in its favor is a priority. The company states on its website that without “legislative certainty”, lawsuits over its glyphosate-based Roundup herbicide and other weed killers can affect its research and product development and other “important investments”.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should be the ultimate arbiter of product safety and what warnings should be required on product labels, Bayer says. The company also says if the EPA approves a product label, consumers should not be able to sue companies for failing to warn of perceived risks.\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Bayer said federal legislation is “needed to ensure that states and courts do not take a position or action regarding product labels at odds with congressional intent, federal law and established scientific research and federal authority”.\nBayer has already removed glyphosate, classified as “probably” carcinogenic to humans by World Health Organization cancer experts, from consumer herbicide products. And the company has threatened to stop selling it to farmers if the litigation is not brought to an end.\nThe company disputes, however, that the appropriations bill will provide that certainty, saying in its statement that the language doesn’t prevent lawsuits and asserting it does is a “distortion of reality”.\nThe relevant section of the House version of the appropriations bill – section 453 – does not mention litigation or pesticide company liability. Section 453 simply says that no funds can be used to “issue or adopt any guidance or any policy, take any regulatory action, or approve any labeling or change to such labeling” inconsistent with the conclusion of an EPA human health assessment.\nBut critics say the language effectively would impede states and local governments from warning about risks of pesticides even in the face of new scientific findings about health harms if such warnings are not consistent with outdated EPA assessments. The EPA itself would not be able to update warnings without finalizing a new assessment, the critics say.\nDue to the limits on warnings, consumers would find it nearly impossible to sue pesticide makers for failing to warn them of health risks if the EPA assessments do not support such warnings.\nThe language is “by design sneaky and complicated and hard to explain”, said Daniel Hinkle, senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice, who has been lobbying against the action.\n“Nobody thinks that a giant chemical company should be able to lie about the risks of using their product and get away with it. It’s just making sure that people understand that is what is at stake,” Hinkle said.\nRepresentative Chellie Pingree, a Democrat from Maine who tried but failed to overturn the language in a July appropriations committee hearing, said she is “very worried” about the “outrageous” efforts to protect pesticide companies from litigation.\n“We’re talking about chemicals here that are already prone to health risks,” Pingree said. “And the chemical industry is trying to keep that information from consumers … and then to have immunity from being responsible if you get cancer from being in the presence of these chemicals.”\nThe language is not currently included in the short-term government spending package being debated ahead of a looming government shutdown that would occur at the end of the month in the absence of continued spending authorization.\nBut it is expected to see support in both House and Senate appropriations bill versions once the short-term budget is resolved. The new farm bill is also expected to include language limiting or preventing pesticide injury lawsuits, with strong signals from Glenn Thompson, chair of the House committee on agriculture, favoring such protections.\nPreviously, Thompson has weighed in on the side of Bayer amid its ongoing efforts to get the supreme court to weigh in on federal “preemption” over pesticide regulation.\nThe involvement and influence of the Maha movement, made up of voters from both parties, is adding a bipartisan element to what otherwise might be a highly partisan fight.\nMax Lugavere, a health journalist, author and podcaster who posted a photo of a Maha-related visit to the White House to his 1.1 million Instagram followers, said pushing lawmakers is important, but “awareness among everyday people is the first domino”.\nCiting “growing evidence linking pesticides to health risks”, Lugavere said: “Stripping away legal recourse in these cases wouldn’t just be wrong, it would be [a] tragedy.”\nFor California lawyer Brent Wisner, who helped lead the early Roundup litigation against Bayer, the efforts by lawmakers to protect the company against future litigation is un-American and potentially unconstitutional.\n“I don’t care what party you are in, if you get poisoned by a pesticide manufacturer you want to be able to sue. You need to be able to sue,” he said. “Bayer is paying millions of dollars to get these laws passed because it’s cheaper than it is to pay people they’ve given cancer to.”\nThis story is co-published with the New Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group"

    "body": "Donald Trump is a man with no medical training. However, that’s never stopped the very stable genius from inflicting his unhinged health views on the rest of us, has it? Back in 2020, for example, Trump memorably mused that injecting disinfectant could help fight the coronavirus – which forced the maker of Dettol and Lysol to put out an urgent statement explaining that this was a very bad idea.\nNow the president, who once vowed to be a protector of women “whether they like it or not”, has turned his attention to prenatal care. “Taking Tylenol is, uhhhh, not good,” Trump said on Monday, with his trademark eloquence. He was flanked by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, the guy who told Congress this year that “people shouldn’t take medical advice from me”.\nTrump went on to link autism to prenatal exposure to acetaminophen, which is the active ingredient in Tylenol. If you’re feeling poorly while pregnant you should “fight like hell” not to take Tylenol to relieve your pain, the president instructed. Which basically means suffering instead: ibuprofen, for instance, is generally not recommended after week 20 of pregnancy.\n“If you can’t tough it out, if you can’t do it, that’s what you’d have to do,” Trump continued. “You’ll take a Tylenol, but it’ll be very sparingly. Can be something that’s very dangerous to the woman’s health, in other words, a fever that’s very, very dangerous, and ideally, a doctor’s decision, because I think you shouldn’t take it and you shouldn’t take it during the entire pregnancy.”\nLike everything Trump says, this incoherent quote makes zero sense. But the bottom line here is that the Trump administration is advancing wildly irresponsible guidance. There is no evidence for a causative link between acetaminophen and autism and many experts were aghast at Trump’s statements. Indeed, even the moral vacuum that is JD Vance balked at repeating Trump’s advice, instead urging women to lean on their doctors. And while Trump claimed that there is “no downside” in avoiding Tylenol, an untreated fever during pregnancy could cause problems for the baby.\nTrump’s demand that pregnant women “tough it out” is also deeply misogynistic and a reminder of how women’s pain is often misunderstood or ignored. Numerous studies show that the medical establishment takes men’s pain more seriously. A 2022 study from the Journal of the American Heart Association, for example, found that women who visited emergency departments with chest pain waited 29% longer than men to be evaluated.\nThis sudden Tylenol scare is also yet another example of mom-shaming. “ We really have a long history of blaming mothers in this country, and we’re seeing that reinforced through the narratives around autism’s causes right now,” Martine Lappé, a sociology professor, told NPR.\nWomen are shamed for not getting pregnant or waiting “too long” to get pregnant. They’re shamed (and, increasingly, criminalized) for losing a pregnancy. They’re shamed for everything from the size of their baby bump to what they eat while they’re pregnant. They’re called out for exercising while expecting – or not exercising enough. And if they give birth to a baby that isn’t able-bodied or neurotypical, women are often told it’s probably because of something they did. It’s their fault.\nWhile pregnant women are often treated like public property, expectant fathers are not treated with the same scrutiny. About 15% of couples in the US have trouble conceiving, and, by one count, over 50% of the time a male infertility issue contributes. Yet women are traditionally blamed. Indeed back in the 1940s researchers even posited that women’s unconscious hatred of their husbands was what stopped them from conceiving. We’ve moved on from that a bit, but infertility is still widely thought of as a woman’s problem.\nStudies have also found a link between advanced paternal age and autism. But does society constantly shame men for having kids later in life? Of course not. When a 59-year-old Trump fathered Barron, he crowed to the press about his virility. “I continue to stay young, right? I produce children, I stay young,” said Trump at the time.\nNo doubt there are numerous things motivating this sudden Trump administration obsession with Tylenol, including a need to distract people from those pesky Epstein files. However, a concern for women’s health is absolutely not at the heart of it. Rather, this is yet another way to control women; another way to reduce us to walking wombs rather than multidimensional human beings. This war on Tylenol is also very much a war on women. Now, if only there was a pill we could take to help deal with this Maga-induced malaise. As it is, we are all just going to have to tough it out.\nConsidering it is common knowledge that Errol Musk fathered at least one child with his former stepdaughter, who was only four years old when he married her mother, these new accusations, reported by the New York Times, are not a huge surprise. Errol, meanwhile, has dismissed the allegations as “nonsense” and “rubbish.”\nKate Evert got into weightlifting when she was 69 after her kids nagged her to go to the gym. Now she’s getting ready to travel from Missouri to Cape Town for the World Masters Powerlifting Championships. There are some excellent videos of her deadlifting in this Guardian piece.\nOn Friday the Slovak parliament voted on steps that will lead to the recognition of only two genders, restrict sexuality education, and limit adoption to only married heterosexual couples.\nSign up to The Week in Patriarchy\nGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equality\nafter newsletter promotion\nTwo young women and a 15-year-old girl were lured to a house by suspected drug traffickers and then murdered on a livestream that went out to a closed Instagram group.\nA Santa Clarita dentist joked two years ago that she cuts back on pain relief for patients who aren’t Trump supporters. Now the video has gone viral and the dentist is reminding us it was just a gag. Hilarious!\n“I was about 13 when my family decided to marry me off to a man of 29,” an anonymous Iraqi woman writes in the Guardian. “Any attempt to refuse this groom in front of him or his family, I was told, would end in my death… My experience was not an isolated incident, but an early glimpse of what Iraq’s new law legalising marriage from the age of nine may mean.”\nScience and Technology Minister Gila Gamliel of the ruling Likud party told Israel’s Channel 12 that Gaza is being made unlivable. “There must be voluntary migration in order for us to fulfill the war aim of ensuring that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future,” she said, according to the Times of Israel. “I am even optimistic that [there will be voluntary migration from] Judea and Samaria and not just from the Gaza Strip,” Gamliel added, referencing Israel’s name for the occupied West Bank. Israeli government officials have repeatedly made clear that ethnic cleansing is the plan. Mainstream western media outlets have not covered Gamliel’s remarks.\nWhat do you call a bear in winter? A brrrrr! OK, OK, I apologize profusely for that and offer this link to the Fat Bear Week tournament to make it up to you. The fur-midable challenge, run by a national park in Alaska, is meant to find the bear that “exemplifies fatness and success” best, as the animals ready themselves for hibernation.

    "section": "Food",

    "body": "Months of hot weather have produced a record-breaking year for apples in the UK, with the harvest coming in bigger and earlier than ever. That means it’s also going to be a record-breaking year for cider.\nAccording to the National Association of Cider Makers, the warm summer has also delivered apples “full of rich flavours and natural sweetness, perfect for cider making”. In orchards across the UK, boughs are breaking under the weight of the ripening fruit. Thatchers Cider has begun its earliest apple harvest in the company’s 121-year history. At Sandford Orchards near Exeter, they’re installing extra tanks to keep up with production.\nHow will we cope with all the extra cider coming our way? The good news is we have time – the main cider apple crop isn’t harvested until October or even November. But if you want to make a head start, here are 17 choice recipes to help you use up your personal cider quota for the year.\nAs a culinary ingredient, cider is particularly known for its affinity with pork, as demonstrated in Thomasina Miers’s braised pork shoulder with cider and fennel seeds, in which the pork is left to braise in cider for three and a half to five hours; or in Nigel Slater’s pork chops, cider and parsnips, which only takes about 40 minutes on the hob.\nYou can also, of course, simmer a whole gammon joint in cider along with a few spices. Expect to use at least a litre of cider to cover the ham. In leaner times that might seem wasteful, but remember: we’re trying to get on top of a glut.\nDelia Smith’s bangers braised in cider adds a complimentary garnish of sliced and fried apples to the mix, while Yotam Ottolenghi’s chorizo, cider and chickpea stew is a Spanish take on the same idea – Spain has its own tradition of using cider, or sidra, in cooking.\nBut cider is also versatile enough to do its work on other meats. As Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall puts it, “using cider in cooking is a bit like using fruit and wine and perhaps a little vinegar and a pinch of sugar, all at the same time”. His lamb stew with cider deploys it where another recipe might call for stock. It serves a similar purpose in chicken Normandy, and in Slater’s chicken thighs with mushrooms and cider.\nCider has a place in cooking seafood, too, most famously with mussels, where it’s used as a steaming liquid; a serviceable – and maybe, at this time of year, preferable – substitute for white wine. Angela Hartnett’s mussels with cider and pancetta is an object lesson in keeping things simple. Cider and salt-grilled salmon, a winning Guardian reader’s recipe from 2015, uses cider as a marinade for the fish.\nAn onion soup made with cider instead of wine gives that French classic a distinctly British twist. Tom Kerridge’s version is topped with cheese-and-apple toasts made with cheddar and a ripe granny smith cut into matchsticks. Dan Lepard’s rye loaf relies on a yeast, flour and cider mixture left to develop in the fridge overnight.\nWhile it’s less common to turn to cider as an ingredient in cakes and desserts, it’s not unheard of. Nigella Lawson’s cider and five-spice bundt cake is one example, combining ginger, black treacle, cinnamon, Chinese five-spice and cider, baked in a fluted, doughnut-shaped bundt tin. This cider and pumpkin cake uses two bundt cakes joined base-to-base, to recreate the shape of a pumpkin. The recipe tells you to bake the two cakes one after the other, presumably on the supposition that nobody has two bundt tins.\nCider sorbet with cheddar and mint may sound like a slightly challenging collection of flavours, but the cheddar here is a stick of cheese deployed as a garnish – the same way you would a flake in a 99 – and is therefore wholly optional.\nFinally, a classic mulled cider from Jamie Oliver. And just in case you think it’s still too early in the autumn to start mulling things, here’s another recipe for a cocktail called cider gingerade, made from gin, ginger syrup, dry cider and lime juice. It can’t ever be too early for one of those."

    "body": "Travel 18 miles north of London and the grey bulk of a gas power plant comes into view near Rye House railway station in Hertfordshire.\nRye House power station has generated electricity since 1993, making it Britain’s longest-serving such power plant still in the market. But it also produces some of the most expensive electricity in the country.\nThe power plant, owned by a subsidiary of the commodities trading giant Vitol, raised eyebrows in recent years by calling for record high payments to generate power when electricity was in short supply.\nIn the winter of 2022, months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered record high gas market prices, Rye House set its own records by charging £6,000 for every megawatt-hour it generated. UK electricity market prices are typically between £60 and £100 per megawatt-hour.\nIn January, Rye House was one of two power plants that were each paid more than £6m to run their gas turbines for a few hours during a spell of freezing weather.\nThe payments provoked outrage from climate campaigners and consumer groups who have called on the government to hasten Britain’s plan to reduce its reliance on gas power to just 5% of the electricity system by 2030.\nUnder the system to balance Britain’s grid when electricity supply is short, the National Energy System Operator (Neso) encourages energy companies to bid prices at which they would be prepared to power up their plants.\nBut like it or not, these gas plants are here to stay for the foreseeable future. They will still be required to help keep the lights on by the end of the decade, according to official forecasts – and the one-off payments needed to make these plants economic over the course of a financial year are likely to rise.\nVPI, which owns Rye House, believes the plant’s high costs are a price worth paying. The company justifies the staggering payments it receives on a per megawatt-hour basis by pointing to the costs of maintaining the plant for much of the year when it is not needed. The power plant is held in preservation mode over the summer, a period in which the plant still incurs some costs but makes no money.\nThe rapid decarbonisation of Britain’s electricity generation, whereby the last coal power station in Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire closed a year ago, has made the grid more unstable. Gas plants and their big, spinning turbines are needed to provide the inertia that wind and solar cannot, helping keep the grid’s frequency stable.\nSenior industry executives have warned that if companies like VPI were unable to cover their costs, and make a justifiable profit, it could spell the closure of Britain’s older gas power plants, which would ultimately lead to higher costs for consumers if new gas plants needed to be built to replace them.\nTo guard against this, the government’s capacity market mechanism was devised in 2012 to secure the future of Britain’s gas plants even as the country shifts away from fossil fuels. Energy companies must vie for contracts that cover the cost of keeping the power plants on standby for when they are needed. Separate auctions offer contracts to gas plants one year in advance or four years in advance.\nThe competition between generators to clinch a contract keeps the auction costs as low as possible, since the lowest bids are the ones that win. So to earn a profit, gas generators still need to top up these earnings by selling electricity into the market.\nRye House runs only 5-10% of the time, meaning its opportunity to turn a profit is limited. In the future, as the UK moves towards a low carbon energy system, many more gas generators will find themselves in the same position.\nSign up to Business Today\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nAn alternative trade-off would be higher prices through the capacity market, according to Tom Glover, the boss of RWE’s UK business. RWE is the UK’s biggest gas generator, and also one of the country’s biggest renewable energy investors. Its plants run more often, meaning they do not typically call for “scarcity prices” on a par with those earned by Rye House.\n“These things have been debated for years,” Glover said. ‘Twenty-five years ago everyone thought relying solely on scarcity pricing was the right economic signal to send. As the years go by, we’re starting to realise that no one wants to accept a price of £1,000/MWh as fair.\n“We’re becoming the fire brigade of the energy system,” he added. “You have to pay for the fire brigade to be around all the time. Hopefully you don’t call on them very often but when you do, they best be there and they best be reliable. Today our gas plants still make up a quarter of the UK’s electricity but this is going to evolve over the next five to 10 years. Eventually we will effectively be paid to be there, rather than getting paid for running.”\nDespite the arguable success of Britain’s capacity market, concerns over whether gas generators are making fair profits have prompted fresh proposals to reform the system. Earlier this month, research by a former government energy mandarin found that the government could save energy users £5bn a year by overhauling the electricity market by removing gas plants from it.\nAdam Bell, the government’s former head of strategy at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, argues that the UK’s gas plants should be held in strategic reserve, available to be fired up when needed without distorting the overall cost of electricity in the wholesale market.\nThe report, which was commissioned by Greenpeace, proposed that gas plants should no longer be able to sell power on the open market, and instead provide a strategic reserve of electricity, at an agreed price, whenever they are required to fire up.\nA senior industry source said that although gas generators are eager to tackle Britain’s energy affordability crisis, the proposals were unlikely to win over private companies. A second source described the proposals as “economically illiterate”.\nCritics of the plan believe that dampening volatility in the electricity market would undermine the incentive needed to spur batteries to release electricity, or for energy users to pause their demand, when supplies are short.\nBut there may still be room for further debate on reforming the market, according to Glover. “We want lower consumer prices, we want lower gas power generation, we want more renewables. We’d like to work with them to achieve the objective we’re all trying to get to, but maybe with a greater understanding of the market,” he said. “There are different ways to get there.”"

    "body": "People who have been in jail since last year awaiting trial for alleged offences relating to Palestine Action activities say they have faced a crackdown since the group was proscribed, including being banned from wearing the keffiyeh and from prison jobs.\nThe prisoners were charged before Palestine Action was banned and none have been charged with Terrorism Act offences, although the Crown Prosecution Service has said there is a “terrorism connection”.\nNevertheless, they say they have had restrictions imposed since the direct action protest group was classified alongside the likes of Islamic State and Boko Haram.\nTeuta Hoxha, 29, who is charged with criminal damage, aggravated burglary and violent disorder in relation to an action at Elbit Systems ​in Filton, n​ear Bristol, last year​, was removed from her library job at HMP Peterborough.\nWhen she complained, she received a letter from the prison’s head of female services saying: “In July 2025, the home secretary proscribed Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences you are held on remand for are linked to Palestine Action and impact roles that are considered appropriate for you. The library orderly role is not considered appropriate.”\nHoxha, who recently went on hunger strike for four weeks, said she had a striped green, white, red and black scarf she made in knitting class taken away because it was the colours of the Palestinian flag.\nHoxha said her sister was removed from her prisoner call list because of her sister’s political views, said to align with those of Palestine Action, after she and two other inmates held in relation to Filton were told they had been categorised as terrorists by the joint extremism unit.\nPalestine Action, which predominantly targeted the UK sites of the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems and companies that do business with it, was proscribed on the basis of intelligence assessments, one of which said it was “mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to property”.\nAudrey Corno, 23, who is on bail awaiting two trials for alleged Palestine Action protests pre-proscription, said: “She [Hoxha] was arrested in November 2024, way before proscription so it’s completely banal for them to apply this retrospectively, and it’s completely punitive the way that they’re using this.”\nZoe Rogers, 21, who is awaiting trial on the same Filton-related alleged offences as Hoxha, complained after she did not receive a keffiyeh, which had been sent to her at HMP Bronzefield.\nThe response said the headscarf, commonly worn to express Palestinian identity or solidarity, had been withheld “because it features branding associated with the Palestine Action Group (PAG)”.\nIt continued that Rogers, who has been in jail since August last year, was awaiting trial for offences connected with PAG, which “has been formally recognised and is now treated under the Terrorism Act 2000 … In light of this, I considered the decision to withhold the item to be reasonable and proportionate under given circumstances.”\nOther prisoners at HMP Bronzefield subsequently had their keffiyehs taken away. Corno said the headscarf “pre-dates Palestinian Action by centuries”.\nA spokesperson for Sodexo, which runs HMPs Bronzefield and Peterborough, said, they did not comment on individual cases but that they managed prisoners in line with policies governing the entire prison estate, including “specialist multi-agency processes to assess individual terrorist risk and security status”.\nThey said: “The removal of Palestinian keffiyehs has been carried out in accordance with the prisoner property framework, which sets standards on acceptable items of clothing and headwear across the estate.”\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said all prisoners were subject to the same rules, adding: “Flags, symbols and other items that might threaten safety, order or security can be confiscated.”"

    "body": "The US state department is appointing a dedicated official to handle the case of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old dual American-Palestinian citizen who has been held in an Israeli military prison for more than seven months.\nIbrahim is scheduled to meet with the new state department point person next week, marking an escalation in diplomatic efforts surrounding the Florida teenager’s imprisonment at the Ofer military prison in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nThe development comes as Ibrahim’s family has intensified its campaign for the boy’s release. Last week, relatives joined other families of Americans killed or detained by Israeli forces or settlers in a series of high-profile meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\nThat trip included sit-downs with more than a dozen members of Congress, as well as a press conference with the representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and the families of Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, Sayfollah Musallet and Tawfic Ajaq, all of whom were killed by in the West Bank in the last two years. They were accompanied by the parents of Rachel Corrie, the American activist killed by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip in 2003. The US government has not independently investigated any of these deaths, deferring instead to Israel’s own inquiries.\nThe Guardian first reported that Ibrahim was arrested in February at age 15 from his family’s home in the West Bank over allegations of rock throwing. The Guardian first mentioned Ibrahim’s imprisonment after reporting on Musallet, his cousin, who was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers on the family’s farm in July.\nThe teenager has lost significant weight during his detention and at one point had contracted scabies. His family said they have been unable to maintain regular contact with him.\nThe Guardian has reached out to Israel’s prison service, foreign ministry and military for comment. Military court documents reviewed by the Guardian show Israeli authorities accuse Ibrahim of throwing rocks at Israeli vehicles in at least two separate incidents.\nThe state department said in a statement that it provides appropriate consular assistance to all citizens detained abroad, but that it would not comment further given “privacy and other considerations”.\nThe case has drawn attention from Florida lawmakers, including Kathy Castor, who has publicly called for his release. More than 100 civil rights and faith-based organizations in the US also signed a letter demanding his release and US government intervention.\nÖzden Bennett, the sister of 26-year-old Eygi, who was killed by an Israeli sniper last year while attending a protest against settlement expansion in the West Bank, grew emotional when speaking of Ibrahim while in Washington. “He feels like my little brother,” she said in a meeting with Virginia representative Jim McGovern. “I can’t do anything for my sister but we can help him”.\nIn a meeting with senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, she called on them to travel to the Ofer prison to demand his release, invoking Van Hollen’s visit to El Salvador to meet with Kilmar Ábrego García, a man who was sent there by the Trump administration despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation.\nVan Hollen and Merkley met with Ibrahim’s father during their Middle East delegation trip earlier this month, their offices confirmed.\nMerkley said in a statement to the Guardian that he was “heartbroken” to hear about Ibrahim’s imprisonment. “He deserves humane treatment and a fair trial,” he added. “My colleagues and I call on Secretary of State Rubio and the Netanyahu government to uphold Ibrahim’s basic human rights and dignity.”"

    "body": "It was perhaps inevitable that a proposal to build a military base on the outskirts of Narva, Estonia’s third largest city, located directly on the country’s border with Russia, featured in this week’s TV debate among the candidates vying to be mayor.\nJust days earlier, three MiG-31 Russian fighter jets had entered and stayed in Estonia’s airspace above the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes, prompting the Estonian government to call rare article 4 consultations with Nato allies over a risk to “territorial integrity, political independence or security”.\nEstonia upped the stakes by bringing the issue to the UN security council in New York where western allies warned of dire consequences of further breaches. Donald Trump signalled his support for shooting down Russian jets.\nThe febrile geopolitical climate was then made even more tense after a spate of unmanned aerial vehicle forays over Danish airports that forced the country’s largest, in Copenhagen, to close. It followed recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania. “We are at the beginning of a hybrid war against Europe,” said Mette Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, in an address to the nation.\nIt might be thought, then, that there would be loud acclaim for a military presence in Narva, separated from Russia by a 101-metre-wide river, traversed by a “Bridge of Friendship” on which the Estonians have built a line of 3ft concrete dragons’ teeth and are constructing a heavy security gate.\nBut Narva, closer to St Petersburg than the Estonian capital, Tallinn, is complex: 98% of its population is primarily Russian speaking and, while not a homogenous group, international news can be perceived quite differently here, as it is in other such communities in Latvia and Lithuania.\nFor some it is consumed through the prism of Russian TV, banned in Estonia but easily accessible at this proximity to the country. The Kremlin has denied the breach of Estonian airspace ever happened – the “Nazis” in Tallinn, 210km west of Narva, were doing what the “global war party” does.\nOthers in Narva see such claims on Russia’s TV stations as fake news but worry about poking the Russian bear. Estonian troops are welcome perhaps, they say, but not foreign Nato soldiers.\nThe candidates in the TV debate generally accepted that the military base was a done deal but criticised the communication of it, saying it had sparked concerns within the city of 53,000 people rather than a sense of assurance.\nThe Russian incursion into Estonian airspace and its suspected involvement in the drone attacks has certainly been a test of Nato – but it is something more.\nThe reactions of the Baltic states and their allies to provocations are proving a test in themselves to the resilience and the unity of countries that remain home to large Russian-speaking communities.\nLocal elections are coming up in Estonia in October and it is shot through with risk, said Katri Raik, a former national interior minister, who is the mayor of Narva and in the race for a fourth term.\nA socially and economically disadvantaged city where the phasing out of the oil shale mines has hit hard, Narva was largely ignored for decades by Tallinn and that was fine by the residents, who thought of it as something of an island, she suggested. But in recent years, the state has become “really close”, said Raik.\nFollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Estonian government ordered the removal of up to 400 Soviet monuments that they argued commemorated not the liberation of the country but its occupation from 1945.\nThe most controversial was a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal on the outskirts of Narva. It caused an uproar. Raik, who is among the 2% of the population who speak Estonian as a first language, received death threats when she sought to be a mediator between the government and local people.\nThen, at a time when the cost of heating has tripled in two years, the closing of the Bridge of Friendship to vehicles and freight, leaving only pedestrian access to the Russian border town of Ivangorod, has been an economic blow. It was the Russians who closed it first but the extra checks enforced by the Estonians on those going by foot is being blamed for the long queues.\nMore recently, there have been claims that Tallinn is repressing religious freedom through its attempt to split the Russian Orthodox church in Estonia from the Moscow patriarchate, which manages it and is seen as being in cahoots with the Kremlin.\nThere was also the passing of a law that phases out the existence of Russian-speaking schools by 2030, causing people to complain that their children were being educated in a language they did not use at home.\n“And the cherry on top,” said Raik, has been the ban on non-EU citizens, including Russians and Belarusians living in Estonia, from voting in local elections.\n“A third of people [in Narva] will not be able to go to vote,” she said. All of this has been magnified and twisted by Russian propaganda. “When it is all together then we might be surprised that we are even alive as a city, for our mental health,” said Raik. “It is really a little bit too much altogether … It’s a big chance for the populists.” The people deprived of voting rights, they have sisters, they have husbands, who can vote, she said.\nMaria Smorževskihh-Smirnova, the director of Estonia’s Narva museum, was caught up in such a cycle of action, reaction and counteraction. This week she was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in a Russian general-regime penal colony.\nHer crime was putting up a large poster on the outer wall of her museum – a castle on the river by the Friendship bridge – that accused Vladimir Putin of being a war criminal and making comparisons between him and Adolf Hitler.\nThe target of her message was those who gathered at the Russian side on 9 May to celebrate Victory Day and the end of the second world war on a newly built square, just below the ramparts of their own castle across the river.\nThere the Russians put up large screens facing in the direction of Narva showing images of Putin or war movies. “It’s about brutal Russian power,” said Smorževskihh-Smirnova. “It’s about the cult of death, about the cult of war, and about the glorification of [the] Ukrainian invasion.”\nFor her “very small” protest, she was subject to a torrid barrage of hate on social media. Messages included “I will kill you, I know where you walk, I know where you live”, she said. “But we will be just silent or just ignored? No.”\nIt is the sort of emotional response that Egert Belitsev, the director general of the Estonian border force, does not countenance. The Russian provocations are endless in Narva, he said.\nSurveillance blimps appear in the sky, asylum seekers surreptitiously followed by Russian border guards with video cameras have been steered over the bridge (and then pushed back by the Estonian guards), GPS signals have been jammed, crippling search and rescue operations, and buoys in the river demarcating the border have been removed.\n“It’s something in order to cause some mess, to see how we react,” he said. “How far are we willing to go? What are we able to do?”\nEach reaction by the Estonian authorities is portrayed by Kremlin propagandists as militaristic, belligerent and an attack on the rights of the Russian-speaking people in Narva. This despite Putin suggesting in 2022 that it would be justifiable to “take back and secure” Narva for Russia.\nTalk of the appearance among the brutalist Soviet-style blocks in Narva of “little green men”, the colloquial term for unmarked Russian soldiers, are roundly said to be far-fetched but it does not need to go that far to be damaging.\nIgor Taro, Estonia’s interior minister, a former journalist, is in charge of carefully calibrating government policy. He makes regular visits to the city a priority; indeed the country’s prime minister, Kristen Michal, was in Narva opening Europe’s largest rare-earth magnet factory when he received news of the Russian jets’ breach of the airspace.\nEach of the government’s contentious policies, Taro insisted, had an explanation. The Russian-language schools were driving segregation. The symbols of occupation needed to be removed. The opportunity of citizens of an aggressor state to vote in Estonian elections was no longer appropriate or safe. But he is not blind to the dangers.\n“We were in a kind of situation where it was hard not to react, to do these decisions,” he said.\nThe Estonian security services keep a watchful eye on Narva, he said. On Thursday, a Narva citizen was convicted of spying for the FSB, the Russian security service, since 2017, and seeking to sow discord.\n“He was just a regular working guy, but very social, communicating with lots of different people, and could gather quite different information,” said Taro.\nThe Estonian government learned from the experience in Ukraine, he said, where political activists emerged in Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, and ultimately spearheaded break-away republics.\n“That’s what we are trying to avoid here,” he said. “They are trying to do it. They’re trying to prepare the soil, in information warfare and in all the kinds of domains, but we have the measures to cut them off.”\nHe added: “We have been training for all other possibilities with this bridge”.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "body": "Most supermarket coffee disappoints: often stale and over-roasted, and with unpleasant notes of rubber and burnt ash. That said, as someone who prefers a lighter roast coffee (that is, bright, fruity and acidic), I was pleasantly surprised by some of the brands I found among all the dark-roasted offerings that dominate our supermarket shelves.\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\nI focused on fresh coffee that’s sold ready-ground for general use in cafetières, filters or moka pots (depending on the grind size, some leaned better towards one method than another, which I’ve noted where necessary). Ideally, however, coffee should be freshly ground for purpose, with a fine, sandy grind for moka pots, and a coarse, gritty one for filters and cafetières. I judged each coffee on flavour, provenance, sustainability and value, while bearing in mind that its quality depends on every stage of the production process, from growing and selection to fermentation, drying, roasting and storage. Coffee also carries a huge social and environmental weight, which makes certifications such as Fairtrade and organic, as well as independent social and ecological initiatives, so important.\nThe results were mixed. Some coffees were predictably dreadful, but others were surprisingly good value. One key finding stood out, however: the most expensive supermarket products rarely justify their price.\nCoffee is something of an art, so I brought in a professional to help guide my tasting. Will Whiting, founder of Calm Coffee Roastery in Peckham, south London, welcomed me to his space where two tables were carefully laid out for a cupping session (cupping is the global standard for assessing coffee quality). We measured 12g of each sample into individual bowls, noted the dry aromas, then filled the bowls to the brim with hot water. After four minutes, we broke the crust of grounds with spoons, and inhaled the aroma as the gases released. We then skimmed off any remaining grounds and let the brews rest and sit for 10 minutes before tasting from spoons, which spread the coffee instantly across the tongue, revealing its flavour in a burst. We then took notes on the acidity, body and nuanced flavour.\nWhat did we discover? The bottom-shelf coffees are as bad as we’d expected: harsh, bitter and good for nothing more than a morning caffeine kick. But there were surprises, too. Perhaps the biggest lesson was that the most expensive supermarket coffees – often priced on a par with coffee from top micro-roasteries – just don’t deliver. If you want truly exceptional coffee, skip the supermarket’s so-called premium bags and order online from independent roasters who provide small-batch beans of good provenance, named varietals traceable to individual farms and, crucially, clear roasting dates, which helps ensure a coffee’s freshness.\n★★★★☆\nThis farmer-owned lighter roast surprises the palate with malty, caramel notes, smooth body and a bright hazelnut finish. Each pack funds two school meals – a true example of flavour and strong social purpose coming together to add real value.\n★★★☆☆\nExcellent value and a step up in quality with clear provenance. Smells of fresh toast and chocolate, and has a brightness that comes through in the cup with a medium-low acidity and subtle, nutty notes. Smooth, enjoyable and Rainforest Alliance-certified.\n★★★★☆\nThe most interesting aroma of the test; bright and rounded with a lower acidity. Berry, dark chocolate and umami on the nose, with cereal and stone fruit in the cup. A washed 100% arabica from Chiapas, Mexico, that’s also Fairtrade, organic and B Corp-certified. Ethically sourced, complex and very enjoyable. This says it’s ground for cafetières, but even so, it worked beautifully for an espresso from my moka pot, too.\n★★★★☆\nA lighter roast with cacao and fruity notes on the nose. Caramel and medium acidity in the cup. Conservation-led, reforestation-focused and carbon credit-backed. Purpose-driven, flavourful and with a Great Taste Award star.\n★★★☆☆\nA dark, leathery roast with hay on the nose. Bold, intense and medium in acidity, with Colombian arabica beans roasted in Brixton. The company is independent and B Corp certified.\nSign up to The Filter\nGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox. The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

    "body": "A Polish adventure skier has made history by becoming the first person to climb up and ski down Mount Everest without the use of additional oxygen.\nThe ascent was Andrzej Bargiel’s third attempt at climbing Everest – the tallest mountain on earth at 8,849 metres (29,032ft) high – after dangerous conditions forced the 37-year-old to abandon earlier attempts in 2019 and 2022.\n“The summit itself was arduous and difficult. I’d never spent so much time at such an altitude in my life, so that was a challenge in itself,” Bargiel said. “Skiing down Everest without oxygen was a dream that had been growing inside me for years.”\nMore than 6,000 people have climbed the mountain, according to the Himalayan database, but only about 200 have done it without additional bottled oxygen. A few people have skied back down, but never a continuous downhill without supplementary oxygen.\nIt took nearly 16 hours on Monday for Bargiel to climb through the “death zone”, which is above 8,000m where oxygen levels are dangerously low.\nAt the top of the mountain the air is so thin that climbers only get about a third of the oxygen available at sea level. This can cause brain damage, fluid in the lungs, and even death.\nSign up to The Recap\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\nafter newsletter promotion\nOn Tuesday morning, he skied down through the Khumbu Icefall, a maze of ice towers and deep crevasses known as one of Everest’s most dangerous sections, before arriving at base camp. He was guided through this section partly by a drone flown by his brother, Bartek.\n“I split the descent into two parts, as navigating the technically difficult icefall in relatively safe conditions was only possible in the morning,” said Bargiel.\nBargiel’s team said in a statement that it was a “groundbreaking milestone in the world of ski mountaineering”.\nThe Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, celebrated on X, writing: “Sky is the limit? Not for Poles! Andrzej Bargiel has just skied down Mount Everest.”\nIn 2018, Bargiel became the first person to ski down Pakistan’s K2, the second highest mountain in the world.\nIn an interview with the Guardian in 2020 he said: “No one thought it could be done; even my own brother had doubts. It taught me the value of patience – and that nobody else can make your dreams come true.”"

    "section": "Opinion",
    "publication_date": "2025-09-27T11:00:43Z",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/27/trump-attack-george-soros",
    "body": "As a former federal prosecutor, I know that prosecutors should be guided by the facts. But in his determination to hound George Soros, Donald Trump wants prosecutors to become agents of his personal vendetta, facts be damned. That is the conclusion to be drawn from the instructions issued by one of Trump’s senior justice department officials to a group of US attorney’s offices across the country, telling them to investigate Soros’s foundation.\nThis is the latest step in Trump’s implementation of the autocrat’s handbook, with the aim of chipping away at the checks and balances on presidential authority. Having already attacked judges, lawyers, media companies and universities, Trump now sets his sights on civil society. Soros, a longtime and extraordinarily generous funder of progressive causes around the world including in the United States, is Target Number 1. Trump shares this fixation with the likes of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, Europe’s most prominent autocrat, who for years has used Soros as a scapegoat for widespread and growing dislike of his corrupt, self-serving rule.\nAs the name of Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) suggests, he promotes the free and public exchange of ideas. Soros made his billions by recognizing that markets are fallible. He gave away billions based on the insight that human governance is imperfect, too, and that the best way to compensate is with independent voices engaged in free debate. Having survived as a Jewish boy in Hungary under Nazi rule, Soros understands that we are safer when people can contest government dogma.\nSoros has funded not only human rights activists who defend open societies but also intellectuals and journalists who have pushed the limits of public debate, as well as organizations devoted to redressing a range of injustices. My former organization, Human Rights Watch, was and remains a major beneficiary.\nDespite his brilliance, Soros is too modest to believe he has the ultimate answers to society’s most vexing problems. He is always self-critical, deeply aware of his inability to see the full truth, skeptical of any moment’s conventional wisdom.\nAt age 95, he has stepped back from an active role in his foundation, which is now chaired by his son Alex. But his vision still guides the foundation and is antithetical to Trump’s delusional belief that he alone is the guardian of all wisdom while critics are to be demonized and persecuted. Soros has the self-confidence to eschew the kinds of sycophantic lackeys whom Trump prefers.\nThe debate that Soros has long promoted is peaceful. That is the essence of the open society that he champions. OSF recently reiterated that they “unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism. Our activities are peaceful and lawful, and our grantees are expected to abide by human rights principles and comply with the law.”\nBut that has not stopped Trump from insinuating without evidence that Soros and OSF are somehow supporters of people who engage in political violence. I have known Soros for more than three decades and have never seen a hint of that. It is the opposite of who he is. But stubborn reality has never impeded Trump and his acolytes in their universe of “alternative facts”.\nStraining to justify the vendetta, Trump’s justice department points to a report issued by a group that calls itself the Capital Research Center. It is filled with tendentious, McCarthyite allusions about OSF grantees having alleged sympathy for Hamas or tolerance of “direct action”, a supposed reference to violence.\nOne of the prominent examples it cites is OSF’s funding of the highly respected Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, one of six Palestinian organizations that the Israeli government in 2021 designated as supposed terrorists. But the Israeli government bandies about accusations of terrorism the same way it tries to silence critics with false allegations of antisemitism. I have worked with Al-Haq throughout my career and have always known it to be a fact-based, principled, and peaceful organization that fairly and objectively investigates and reports on Israeli abuses in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.\nAnother OSF grantee targeted is the human rights group Dawn, which was founded by Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was murdered by the Saudi government. One of its stated offenses is that while it condemned Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack, it focused on the civilian, not the military, victims.\nThat such “evidence” might tempt Trump to order criminal charges against Soros under his newly announced effort to counter “domestic terrorism and organized political violence” means that almost anyone could be targeted.\nIn persecuting Soros, Trump has taken on a tough target. Like Harvard, which successfully sued rather than capitulate, Soros has the means to fight back. Moreover, unlike some law firms that cut deals with Trump to escape his wrath, 100 progressive foundations have announced that they will mount a common defense if any of them faces Trump’s vengeance. That mutual support is the right response to Trump’s divide-and-conquer strategy.\nI would expect that the courts will promptly dismiss any action that Trump takes against Soros. Despite Trump’s efforts to bully them, federal judges have maintained their independence, and many continue to apply the law rather than Trump’s dictates. A fact-free prosecution of a well-known critic is a recipe for judicial rejection.\nBut that doesn’t relieve Soros and his foundation from the burden of defending themselves from fabricated charges, which can be substantial. Trump’s abuse of his power to persecute an independent voice – his posturing to his base in utter contempt of the first amendment – should be widely and firmly denounced. Unless the pushback is intense enough, Soros may be Trump’s first civil society target but not the last.\nKenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. His book Righting Wrongs: Three Decades on the Front Lines Battling Abusive Governments is published by Knopf and Allen Lane"

    "title": "Zuckerberg hailed AI ‘superintelligence’. Then his smart glasses failed on stage | Matthew Cantor",
    "section": "Opinion",
    "publication_date": "2025-09-27T11:00:43Z",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/27/zuckerberg-ai-glasses-fail",
    "body": "As humanity inches closer to an AI apocalypse, a sliver of hope remains: the robots might not work.\nSuch was the case last week, as Mark Zuckerberg attempted to demonstrate his company’s new AI-enabled smart glasses. “I don’t know what to tell you guys,” Zuckerberg told a crowd of Meta enthusiasts as he tried, and failed, for roughly the fourth time to hold a video call with his colleague via the glasses.\nIt was a limp follow-up to an ambitious opening to the event at Meta Connect 2025, a developers conference in Menlo Park, California, where the company is headquartered. The keynote was to feature the Ray-Ban Meta Display, the latest version of what is essentially a face-mounted iPhone – ideal for the consumer who lacks the energy to pull a device from their pocket and idolizes both Buddy Holly and the Terminator. Despite that undeniable appeal, the show was a technical mess – perhaps the perfect homage to the latest pointless iteration of digital hardware.\nThe show had a promising start. Viewers witnessed Zuck making his way to the stage to thumping music, performing an alarming number of fist bumps en route. The moment was presented onscreen through the camera on his glasses, so that the audience could see “Mark’s POV”. All the while, he was receiving a flurry of text messages expressing enthusiasm that was no doubt genuine: “Let’s gooo” followed by a rocketship emoji, “audience is getting hyped” with a picture of two guys looking content at best, a gif saying “It’s time.”\nFinally, Zuck reached the stage, in his now signature big T-shirt and curls. He explained the company’s commitment to attractive eyewear, to the supremely ironic notion that “the technology needs to get out of the way” of human interaction, and to “taking superintelligence seriously”. Superintelligence is going to be “the most important technology of our lifetimes. AI should serve people, not just be something that sits in a data center automating large parts of society,” he said, sweetly assuming that society will exist beyond the next decade.\nThings rolled along smoothly enough until it came time to actually use an AI feature. Zuck held a video call with chef Jack Mancuso, suggesting he make “maybe like a steak sauce, maybe Korean-inspired type thing”, which Mancuso admitted he had never made before, so he “could definitely use the help” of AI.\n“What do I do first?” he asked the oracle.\n“You’ve already combined the base ingredients,” the AI informed him wrongly, “so now grate a pear to add to the sauce.” Long silence.\n“What do I do first?” Mancuso asked again.\n“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce,” the AI patiently reminded him.\n“I think the wifi might be messed up. Sorry. Back to you, Mark.” (Certainly it was the wifi and not the AI itself.)\nTo his credit, Zuckerberg remained poised. “It’s all good. You know what? It’s all good,” he said. “The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology, and then the wifi on the day kind of catches you.”\nAI demo failures are nothing new. They are something of a tradition at Google, where last year a presenter used its Gemini tool to scan a Sabrina Carpenter concert poster listing her tour dates. “I’ll just open Gemini, take a photo, and ask: ‘Check my calendar and see if I’m free when she’s coming to San Francisco this year.’” The bot’s response was dead silence. (It finally worked on the third try, on a different device.)\nThis year, when Google showed off a translation feature on its own smart glasses, it failed after about 15 seconds. To be fair, just because there’s an error in a high-stakes tech presentation doesn’t mean a product won’t work, as anyone who watched a certain Tesla Cybertruck presentation will recall. When a designer threw a metal ball at the truck’s “armor glass” windows, it smashed them. That truck went on to a glorious future, earning the coveted title of “deadlier than a Ford Pinto”.\nAt this point in his presentation, you might assume Zuckerberg would leave nothing to chance. But when it came time to demonstrate the Ray-Ban Meta Display’s unique new wristband, he opted against using slides and decided to try it live.\nThe wristband is what he called a “neural interface” – in a genuinely remarkable feat of technology, it allows you to type through minimal hand gestures, picking up on the electrical signals going through your muscles. “Sometimes you’re around other people and it’s, um, good to be able to type without anyone seeing,” Zuckerberg told the crowd. The pairing of glasses and wristband is, in short, a stalker’s dream.\nAt least when it works. Zuckerberg attempted to call his colleague Andrew Bosworth over and over again, the audience sitting in silence as the incoming-call music played. But the CEO was unable to pick up. “That’s too bad. I don’t know what happened,” he said after the first failed attempt. Then came another – “I’m just gonna pick that up with my neural band,” he said with a straight face – but again, he couldn’t do it, as the “missed video call” alerts stacked up on the onstage display, still showing “Mark’s POV”.\n“I don’t know what to tell you guys, alright, but we’re gonna have Boz come out here and we’re just gonna go to the next thing that I wanted to show and hope that will work.” A sign at the back of the room, visible onscreen, read: “Live demo – good luck”.\nIf it was all an exercise in humanizing Zuckerberg, it worked: it was easy to pity the boy wonder, 41, as he fidgeted with the controls and did his best to smile through it all.\nBut the event as a whole felt like an out-of-touch millennial nightmare, a surreal relic of early 2000s optimism that only a cloistered Silicon Valley billionaire could embrace. The fanfare was reminiscent of Steve Jobs’ unveiling of the iPhone in 2007, with two big differences: back then, the US wasn’t collapsing offstage – at least not so obviously – and meanwhile, it was abundantly clear why a person might actually desire the device being announced. It was the internet! In your pocket! When could we get our hands on this marvel of human ingenuity?\nThis event – and much of the AI push, as generative tools are crowbarred into hardware and software that appeared to work fine without it – wants to harness the same energy without a remotely comparable product.\nTo a layperson, at least, it seems that consumer technology has long since entered an era of solutions in search of problems – particularly troubling at a time when the world is facing so many genuinely intractable crises. As entertaining as it is to watch our tech overlords flounder on stage, it raises bigger questions, such as: who exactly asked for this, beyond the billionaires cashing in? And: can we just not?"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/27/meat-gas-emissions-reporting",
    "body": "Food and agriculture contribute one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions – second only to the burning of fossil fuels. And yet the vast majority of media coverage of the climate crisis overlooks this critical sector, according to a new data analysis from Sentient Media.\nThe findings suggest that only about a quarter of climate articles in 11 major US outlets, including the Guardian, mention food and agriculture as a cause. And of the 940 articles analyzed, only 36 – or 3.8% – mentioned animal agriculture or meat production, by far the largest source of food-related emissions.\nThe data reveals a media environment that obscures a key driver of the climate crisis. Meat production alone is responsible for nearly 60% of the food sector’s climate emissions and yet its impact is sorely underestimated: a 2023 Washington Post/University of Maryland poll found 74% of US respondents believe eating less meat has little to no effect on the climate crisis.\nSentient Media analyzed the most recent online articles about climate change from 11 major U.S. outlets – the Guardian, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, CNN, Los Angeles Times, New York Post, New York Times, Reuters, Star Tribune, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. Opinion pieces, syndicated stories, and articles that mention climate change only in passing were excluded.\nThe final group of 940 stories was collected using artificial intelligence and then reviewed individually for accuracy. Of all the causes surveyed in the report, including mining, manufacturing, and energy production (55.9%); fossil fuels (47.9%); and transportation (34%), livestock and meat consumption were by far discussed the least.\nSentient Media’s editor-in-chief, Jenny Splitter, who helped oversee the report, said she had long noticed the omission as a reporter covering the intersection of climate and food. “We thought one way to start the conversation with other journalists and newsrooms was to put some numbers to the question,” she said.\nMark Hertsgaard, the executive director and co-founder of Covering Climate Now, a non-profit that helps newsrooms strengthen their climate reporting, said daily news outlets struggle to emphasize the deeper root causes of climate change – often focusing on incremental updates over the larger why.\n“It’s not necessarily nefarious,” he said. “But as the climate crisis has accelerated, it is increasingly indefensible for news coverage of climate change not to make it clear that this crisis is driven by very specific human activities – primarily burning fossil fuels. And in second place is food, agriculture, forestry.”\nHertsgaard, who has reported on the climate crisis since 1990, said food and agriculture had long been a “gross oversight” in climate circles. The United Nations climate change summit had no dedicated agriculture focus until 2015, reflecting its neglected status in the world of policymakers, thinktanks, and NGOs – which contributed into the media’s illiteracy on the topic, Hertsgaard said.\nDhanush Dinesh, the founder of the food-systems focused thinktank Clim-Eat, said climate organizations sometimes shy away from the topic due to food’s fraught cultural status, which may have helped to keep it from the media spotlight.\n“Nobody wants to put themselves out there and tell people what to eat – it’s just too sensitive,” he said. “Even within the [climate advocacy] space, we see it’s quite polarizing.”\nThat tension isn’t always so organic. When a 2019 report published by the Lancet showed how reduced-meat diets could feed the world without causing environmental breakdown, an industry-backed coalition helped to fund some of the backlash against it. Beef industry groups take an active approach to messaging, including staffing a 24/7 “command center” in Denver that scans social media for negative stories and deploys counter-messaging.\nJournalist Michael Grunwald said that the food conversation today is lagging about twenty years behind the energy and fossil fuels conversation. He spent years covering climate issues for outlets including Time, Politico and the Washington Post before he started to see the links between the food on our plates and changes in the atmosphere.\n“I didn’t know squat,” he said. “Here’s this important part of the climate equation that I was spectacularly ignorant about. And I realized others probably were, too.”\nSign up to Down to Earth\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\nafter newsletter promotion\nGrunwald’s new book, We Are Eating the Earth, unpacks how dietary choices shape the planet’s surface, playing a massive role in its ultimate fate. That is in part because ruminant livestock – particularly cattle – are a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that warms the planet 80 times faster than carbon dioxide.\nBut feeding billions of farm animals also takes up a lot of space. Half of the earth’s habitable land is already devoted to agriculture, and most of that – about 80% – is grazing pasture and cropland for animal feed, making meat consumption a major driver of deforestation globally. Today, we clear a soccer field’s worth of tropical forest every six seconds, a loss dramatically worsened by humanity’s growing hunger for meat.\n“When you eat a burger, you’re not just eating a cow,” Grunwald said. “You’re eating macaws and jaguars and the rest of the cast of Rio. You’re eating the Amazon. You’re eating the earth.”\nAnd yet this toll tends to be broadly misunderstood, when it is not ignored altogether. Only about 15% of stories analyzed Sentient Media mention land-use changes in connection with the climate crisis.\nPrinceton senior researcher Timothy Searchinger has spent decades making the case that we cannot solve the climate issue without rethinking how we use land.\n“Every tree, after you take out the water, is about 50% carbon. So forests store vast quantities of carbon,” he said. “If we continue to clear forests, we have the capability to dramatically increase climate change.”\nThat conversion of forest into agricultural land takes an unthinkable toll, responsible globally for as much carbon emissions each year as the entire United States. Meanwhile, the global population is expected to grow from 8 billion to 10 billion by 2050. So fixing the climate crisis will mean growing more food with fewer emissions on the same amount of land – or, ideally, even less land.\n“There’s kind of no way to solve the land use problems in the world unless there is moderation of diets – meat consumption, particularly beef – in the developed world,” Searchinger said.\nIf ruminant meat consumption in wealthy countries such as the US declined to about 1.5 burgers per person per week – about half what it is now, still well over the national average for most countries – that alone would nearly eliminate the need for additional deforestation due to agricultural expansion, even in a world with 10 billion people, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.\nThough she acknowledges the 3.8% figure is low, Jessica Fanzo, a professor of climate at Columbia University, said she didn’t blame media as much as the challenge of translating scientific consensus into real action – a structural gridlock that’s made progress, and therefore storytelling, more difficult.\n“Governments are reluctant to push hard on dietary change, livestock emissions, or fertilizer dependence because they trigger cultural sensitivities and risk political backlash,” she said, by email. She also said it is difficult to take action on the vast, decentralized agricultural sector. Climate advocate and author Bill McKibben agreed, pointing out in emailed comments that 20 fossil fuel companies are responsible for much of the world’s emissions, whereas food comes down to the actions of millions of farmers.\nMeanwhile, US agriculture policy is mostly geared toward ramping up commodity grain and animal-feed production through subsidies – an approach that prioritizes cheap calories over reducing carbon emissions. And available demand-side solutions, such as meat taxes or meatless Mondays at public schools, risk touching a cultural third rail.\nBut in this divided environment, media can play a crucial role, said David McBey, a University of Aberdeen behavioral scientist focused on diet-climate links.\n“Information campaigns don’t change behavior,” he said. “But they do lay an important bedrock. If you want behavior to change, it’s important that people know why it should change.”"

More than half the US rated him a failure.\n“People hate Joe Biden,” Harris quotes David Plouffe, her senior strategist and an Obama White House veteran, as saying.\nWhat’s unstated is that Harris was never a vote-magnet. When she ran for attorney general of California in 2010, she won by less than 1%, a margin of fewer than 80,000 votes in a deep blue state. Seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, her bid ended in December 2019, two months before the Iowa caucus.\nFast forward to 2024. Harris’s second White House run was hardly conventional, plunged as she was into the maelstrom with just those 107 Days to go. Clearly, thanks to Biden and his enablers, Harris faced steep challenges. Nonetheless, timidity and indecision pocked her campaign. Fear of being overshadowed led her to pick a disheveled dad for vice-president. No one foisted the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, on Harris. He became her prime-time emotional support pet, all the same.\n“There was a feeling that we needed to feed the beast,” she confides. “But I knew that beast would eviscerate me if I wasn’t properly prepared.”\nThat moment of proper preparation failed to arrive.\nNow Harris unloads on Walz, lacerating him for his poor debate, accusing him of falling into a trap. With cameras rolling, JD Vance, then an Ohio senator, played Mr Nice Guy instead of a pit bull, lulling Walz into somnolent irrelevance.\n“When Tim fell for it and started nodding and smiling at JD’s fake bipartisanship, I moaned to Doug [Emhoff, her husband], ‘What is happening?’” Harris recalls. “I told the television screen: ‘You’re not there to make friends with the guy who is attacking your running mate.’”\nHarris is not finished.\n“The following weekend, Saturday Night Live did a sketch in which actors posed as Doug and me, sitting on our couch, watching the debate. While I did not in fact spit out wine, it was otherwise uncanny in its portrait of our evening.”\nSNL gifted Harris a cameo, a consolation prize at best.\nWalz was not the pick of Harris’s dreams. That honor goes to Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, population 103,000, a fraction of the size of a congressional district. He quit the 2020 race on 1 March, months after Harris, after sharing Iowa with Bernie Sanders, then spent four years as transportation secretary under Biden. Harris felt she couldn’t pick him, because he was a gay man and she was a woman of color. Harris’s campaign memoir may be many things. Profiles in Courage, it is not.\nHarris betrays shortcomings on policy. She says little that is coherent about the border or inflation.\n“Immigration had surged, and to some it felt like an invasion: we couldn’t gaslight the people who felt that way by denying the problem,” she half-heartedly acknowledges.\n“We did not succeed in making a passionate case for a complete immigration overhaul that combined securing the border with a better legal mechanism for the people who arrive here with a dream of success and contribution.”\nIn plain English, the electorate refused to buy what Harris tried to sell.\nRegardless, Harris does not grapple with the incompatibility of porous borders on the one hand, and Obamacare on the other. “Open immigration can’t exist with a strong social safety net,” to quote Paul Krugman. “If you’re going to assure healthcare and a decent income to everyone, you can’t make that offer global.” The costs are too high for enough voters to stomach both.\nIn the end, Donald Trump drew nearly even with Harris among Hispanic voters. In southern Texas, thousands backed Trump, after rebuffing him four years earlier.\nHarris failed to make the case that inflation was “transitory”. She bathes in self-praise for breaking a Senate tie on the Inflation Reduction Act. But congressional titles mean little.\n“Part of the challenge of this very short campaign,” she writes, “was that we had to focus on needs that felt more immediate, like how to deal with the grocery bill or the cost of childcare.”\nThat problem didn’t suddenly arise. The administration appeared clueless, in much the same way the Trump administration now claims prices aren’t rising.\nHarris also elides the role of identity politics as a factor in her defeat. In 2019, she authored The Truths We Hold, signaling her intent to vie for the nomination by running left, seemingly unaware Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren had more credibly staked out that lane.\n“We need to speak truth: that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and antisemitism are real in this country, and we need to confront those forces,” Harris proclaimed.\nUnlike Barack Obama in his 2004 convention speech or in The Audacity of Hope, his 2006 book, Harris left little room for nuance. Nor is she afflicted with a surplus of self-awareness.\n“I wish I could have gotten the message across that there isn’t a distinction between ‘they/them’ and ‘you,’” she writes without a hint of irony, referring to a brutally effective Republican ad on the issue of transgender rights.\n“The pronoun that matters is ‘we’,” Harris says. Now.\nPro-tip: faculty lounge orthodoxies and campus activist jargon can play poorly outside ivy-covered walls.\nHarris also reminisces about “A-list talents such as James Taylor and Yo-Yo Ma” headlining a fundraiser in Martha’s Vineyard. A cultural chasm divides blue-collar voters from such preppy purlieus. Harris offers no prescriptions for healing the breach. As a politician, she lagged among voters without four-year degrees.\n“There is so much at stake,” she intones. “I cannot fail these people.” But she did.\n107 Days is published in the US by Simon & Schuster"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/pakistan-us-oil-deal-analysis-trump",
    "body": "The newfound camaraderie between the US and Pakistan was on full display this week as Donald Trump welcomed Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and the country’s powerful army chief, Asim Munir, into the Oval Office, heralding them both as “great leaders”.\nHaving been cold-shouldered by successive US presidents, this was the first time a Pakistani prime minister had been invited to Washington in more than six years. It was also the unprecedented second time this year that Munir – who holds no official government role – held an intimate meeting with Trump, which many took as a telling signal of where the power to cut deals really lies in Pakistan.\nIslamabad’s charm offensive with Trump since his re-election has included handing over to the US a high profile member of Islamic State’s affiliate in Afghanistan and publicly crediting the US president with preventing hostilities between India and Pakistan escalating into all-out war, even nominating Trump for the Nobel peace prize for his efforts.\nYet what has appeared most effective is Pakistan’s touting of its allegedly untapped natural resources – namely oil, minerals and gas – for US exploration. In July, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that “we have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves. We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership.”\nThe messaging was affirmed by Natalie Baker, the US chargé d’affaires in Islamabad, who told local media that US firms had been “showing keen interest in Pakistan’s oil, gas and mineral sectors, in line with President Donald Trump’s vision”.\nPakistan has already reaped rewards from its promise of oil. After an agreement in August, Trump gave Pakistan a generous 19% tariff on imported goods, the lowest of all south Asia nations and far below the punitive 50% tariffs that its neighbour and nemesis India is facing.\nThis month, a $500m (£370m) deal for the US to invest in Pakistan’s nascent minerals sector – including copper and rare earths – was announced, despite a lack of definitive data on the country’s mineral reserves.\nYet it is the promise of oil that has left experts and former government ministers even more baffled. They stress that there is no reliable proof that Pakistan has any substantive, untapped oil reserves, despite years of the world’s biggest oil companies attempting to find them.\nMoin Raza Khan, a geoscientist and former managing director at Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), which has been at the forefront of oil exploration, said: “What Trump is claiming about Pakistan’s massive oil reserves has nothing to do with reality. It is without the support of any data or evidence. We don’t even know where these massive reserves would be, as we don’t have any surveys and studies so far that show us.”\nKhan was among the experts who emphasised that despite more than half a century of exploration and drilling onshore and offshore, no large-scale commercially viable oil wells had been discovered on Pakistani soil. While some small oil repositories had been found, they produce about 65,000 barrels a day. In comparison, Saudi Arabia produces about 4bn barrels a year.\nThis is far from the first time that proclamations have been made about Pakistan’s potential as a petrostate. The country imports more than 80% of its oil, which is one of the biggest drains on the state coffers, prompting successive leaders to make a push for oil exploration.\nKhan emphasised that over the years, more than 30 international companies, including Total, Shell and ExxonMobil, had come to Pakistan with the hope of finding oil, but had eventually left due to the high cost and security risk of exploration and low reward.\nIn 2015, a survey by the US energy administration estimated that the lower Indus basin in Pakistan could have 9bn barrels of “technically recoverable oil”, a survey that was recently referenced by Pakistan’s minister of state for petroleum, Ali Pervaiz Malik.\nHowever, that survey has been called into question by oil companies. In 2019, the multinational oil corporations ExxonMobil and Eni worked with PPL to find oil and gas reserves offshore. But after spending more than $100m drilling the Kekra-1 Indus G block, nothing was found except a waterbed.\nKhan, who headed PPL during the recent failed oil exploration, said: “A total of only 1.2bn barrels of oil have been discovered so far – which is nothing – and they are claiming they can find 100 times this in just the next three years.\n“It’s just impossible. There is no magic wand to multiply Pakistan’s reserves.”\nIslamabad’s ministry of petroleum declined to comment on questions about Pakistan’s oil reserves.\nDespite the lack of any new evidence, the country is pressing ahead with 40 new offshore and 31 onshore blocks for oil and gas exploration, which will be awarded on 31 October. US companies are among those invited for bidding.\nGA Sabri, a former federal secretary at the ministry of petroleum and former director general petroleum concession, described the claims of massive oil reserves as a “political gimmick” and was sceptical about the success of the oil block auction.\nMuch of Pakistan’s alleged untapped oil and gas reserves are said to be in the regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which are in the midst of insurgencies by Taliban and separatist militants and where foreign companies have been routinely targeted.\nSabri said: “When it comes to exploration of new fields, there are high security risks.”\nHe emphasised that “even if the US does the drilling and starts now, it will take at least two to three decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to do this exploration – and nobody can say for sure reserves will be found”.\nSabri said the success of Pakistan’s onshore oil drilling was nothing short of “a myth”."

    "title": "Mountain gorillas are back from the brink. But what happens if they run out of room?",
    "section": "Environment",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/27/wildlife-endangered-mountain-gorillas-conservation-habitat-national-parks-virunga-uganda-rwanda-drc-aoe",
    "body": "It is sunrise on mount Muhabura, an inactive volcano on the Ugandan-Rwandan border, and Dr Benard Ssebide is in a rush to find a family of mountain gorillas before the tourists arrive. A mass of ferns, vines and thistles encroaches on the path, and the guides hack through brambles with machetes. Above, the forest whistles in the wind, glowing in the morning light.\n“The higher you go, the more the mountain pushes back,” Ssebide says, pausing for breath.\nAfter nearly 45 minutes, a ranger spots patches of flattened grass and large piles of fresh, dark green dung. We are close.\nThen the forest suddenly opens up to nine mountain gorillas – the Nyakagezi family – having their breakfast in a clearing. The enormous silverback munches his way through a thistle, throwing his visitors an indifferent glance.\nNearby, a three-year-old juvenile swings on a vine watched by its mother. An adolescent male tugs at a wild blackberry, carefully picking off leaves to eat and grunting with satisfaction.\nThe Virunga mountains, which range over the border region of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), is one of two remaining homes for this endangered gorilla subspecies, identifiable by their thick fur and stocky frames that help them withstand the harsh conditions.\nIn the 1970s and 80s, barely 250 mountain gorillas were left and naturalists feared extinction was close, as expanding agricultural frontiers and logging devoured their habitat.\nBut decades of intense conservation efforts – through war and the 1994 Rwandan genocide – have worked. Population numbers reached more than 1,000 in 2018 and mountain gorillas were downgraded from critically endangered to endangered by conservation authorities. Next year, an updated count is expected to show another increase. But it has come at an enormous cost in money and human life, and nobody who works with the animals is certain of their future.\nIn the past two decades, more than 220 rangers have been killed in the DRC side of Virunga national park where M23 and other militias and bandits operate with impunity. Thousands of people have been displaced and killed. Even in the safe regions of the apes’ range, the threat from human diseases is growing.\nAs gorilla numbers continue to increase in their last remaining islands of habitat, there is a new concern: what happens if they run out of room? \nIn the dense jungle of Muhabura, Ssebide, from the conservation organisation Gorilla Doctors, and his colleagues Dr Nelson and Dr Fred get to work. From a distance, they check the health of each animal, paying close attention to any signs of sickness or injury.\n“They are all feeding well,” he whispers.\nGorilla Doctor vets, who work across all three countries, are key to the turnaround in mountain gorilla numbers, one of the greatest conservation success stories of the past century.\nOne study attributes half of the increase to the vets and their preventions of dozens of deaths, enabling the population to slowly grow.\n“We have relationships with so many gorillas. Mark [this family’s dominant male] is just one. There are others. There is another born at Christmas in 2000; I saw him as a baby – now he is a silverback leading his own group,” Ssebide says.\nWhen the Gorilla Doctors first started, much of their time was dedicated to dealing with injuries from the primates becoming caught in or lacerated by traps meant for buffalo and antelope in the forest.\nNow respiratory diseases passed from humans have become a bigger problem. Anyone observing the animals now must wear a mask, disinfect their hands and keep their distance.\nThe threat from human colds and flu reflects one of the contradictions at the heart of conservation: humans remain the biggest ongoing threat to gorillas while also being the source of their salvation.\nIn his immaculate khakis, Chemonges Amusa is not a man to be messed with. Stretching his arms around his fellow rangers outside their headquarters, he laughs: “I am the silverback here. These are my blackbacks. Any challenge, big problem.”\nAmusa is the senior warden in charge of the southern section of Bwindi Impenetrable national park in Uganda, the other stronghold of mountain gorillas, and oversees a lucrative chunk of the gorilla business for the Uganda Wildlife Authority.\nEarlier that morning, two groups of foreign tourists – each paying $800 (£585) for one hour with the gorillas – had received their safety briefing.\nThey will see “habituated” mountain gorillas: primate families adapted to being around humans. They are not tame, but have undergone a multi-year process to allow tourist groups to stand metres away as they feed and socialise. Without training, the gorillas would flee from, or attack, people who get too near to them.\nMore than half of the family groups in Bwindi, home to about 460 mountain gorillas, are habituated and regularly visited. Local communities receive a 20% share of the revenue from tourism, and want more gorilla families to undergo the process.\nAs the visitors arrive just after sunrise, 30 women sing and dance to welcome them. A dozen porters wait nearby, hoping to carry bags. Those who struggle with the hike can pay local people $300 to carry them up and down steep hills.\nHabituation – and the economy that has sprung up around it – has been another pillar of conservation success. The money from the more than 40,000 tourists who visited Bwindi in 2024 raised enough to fund the entirety of Uganda’s national park system for a year, says Amusa.\nJust as in Virunga, the Bwindi gorillas are hemmed in by subsistence agriculture, a dividing line between apes and humans. But the money from ecotourism has helped to fund buffer zones, made by planting tea – which gorillas will not eat – around the forest, discouraging them from feeding on crops.\n“We have to habituate for two reasons. One is for tourists, who cannot visit the gorillas if they are very wild – it would be dangerous. The other is so we can monitor them,” says Amusa. “We are very proud of our work. I am happy to see them alive and increasing in numbers,” he says.\nThere is enthusiasm for the gorilla conservation among the villagers, even though it has been a fraught process. In 1991, hundreds of people were moved from their homes when national park boundaries were formalised and the land protected. In some forest areas, Indigenous Batwa hunter-gatherers (formerly known as Pygmies) were forced out. But there have been major efforts to find a balance and funnel benefits back to communities.\nBuhutu Steven, a 44-year-old tea farmer, tends to acres of plants. His land borders a Batwa forest reserve.\n“I feel I contribute to the gorillas’ protection. When I got engaged in planting the tea, it was one way of looking after them. Before, the gorillas were at risk,” he says. “When they habituated gorillas, life here improved. Guests come and they leave something behind.”\nThe gorillas have become a booming industry across the border in Rwanda, too. Were it not for an enormous bamboo stage constructed in the shape of two gorillas, you could be forgiven for confusing Kwita Izina – Rwanda’s annual naming ceremony for baby gorillas – with a music festival.\nFrom early in the morning, a DJ blasts music in the shadow of the Volcanoes national park’s mountains, on the Rwandan side of the Virunga massif. Celebrities, conservationists, artists and businesspeople gather alongside park rangers and guides, with high-profile guests invited to name a baby. This year is a bumper ceremony: 40 babies need a name.\n“This puts the Super Bowl half-time show to shame,” says the film director Michael Bay before introducing his baby gorilla, Umurage, which means “heritage”, to the crowd. He promises to make the “good-looking” infant a movie star.\nThe ceremony, marking its 20th anniversary, is a stark contrast to how things used to be. Near here, the primatologist Dian Fossey was murdered in 1985 during her campaign against poachers. Today, the Rwandan government is increasing the park size by nearly a quarter to provide the gorillas with more habitat. The country has also embraced a high-end ecotourism model. Each visitor pays $1,500 to visit the animals, and some hotels charge more than $20,000 a night.\nAs gorilla numbers creep up, the success of the model is obliging conservationists to consider what may happen if more mountain gorilla habitat is needed in their last two remaining strongholds.\n“Right now, the park is still big enough for the gorillas. We need to work out the carrying capacity. But in the future, if the numbers overwhelm us, the government will ask the community to create more land for them, both for their habitat and the buffer zone,” says Amusa in Uganda.\nResearchers will watch for signs of fighting between gorilla families, an indicator that numbers are putting strain on the available habitat. But for now, most are satisfied that predictions of mountain gorillas’ annihilation have been proved so wrong.\n“The records indicate there were many more gorillas here before. I think these areas could take three times as many,” says Ssebide. “But ultimately, you will never know what will happen as the population grows.”\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield in the Guardian app for more nature coverage"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/florida-open-carry-gun-ruling-chaos-and-confusion",
    "body": "Gun control advocates have likened Florida to the wild west after the state’s attorney general endorsed an appeals court ruling allowing residents to openly carry handguns, a move one Democrat said created a “hot mess” of confusion.\nJames Uthmeier proclaimed that “open carry is the law of the state” following the determination by the first district court of appeal earlier this month said that a 1987 Florida statute banning the open display of firearms contravened the second amendment of the US constitution.\nThe panel sided with a Florida man who was arrested at a Pensacola crosswalk in 2022, waving a copy of the constitution with an exposed pistol in a holster.\nA succession of sheriffs immediately ceded to Uthmeier’s admonishment and said they would no longer arrest or prosecute anybody seen with a visible sidearm in public after the ruling, which took effect on Friday.\nBut several of them also joined gun control activists to point out that the issue is not clear cut. Other gun laws still on Florida’s books prohibit weapons in a variety of places. They include schools, hospitals, courthouses, city and county commissions, and bars, while businesses and private property owners retain the right to ban anyone from their premises with a gun, concealed or otherwise.\nDan Daley, a Democratic state representative, said the situation was “a hot mess” and set up Florida’s Republican dominated legislature for an unwelcome scramble to fix through legislation ambiguities forced upon them by the court ruling.\n“This is the dog catching up with the car, and now they don’t know what to do with it,” said Daley, a former prosecutor and gun owner whose district borders Parkland, site of a 2018 high school mass shooting in which 17 people died.\n“Every year there’s this fight among the Republicans in Tallahassee to out-conservative one another, a handful of members who file an open carry bill, and the Democrats just kind of sit back and hope that the more reasonable Republicans will prevail,” he said.\n“The law enforcement community, which generally leans to the right, don’t want to see it happen either, and will have the quieter conversations with Republicans, and that generally prevails.\n“Now the courts have basically forced their hand. We have law enforcement telling us that this is dangerous and there are some places that we shouldn’t permit open carry, so do Republicans file legislation to limit some of where you can carry, and then is that viewed as a gun restriction?\n“Republicans know this is bad policy. It’s a whole different world for them and I don’t think they really want the fight.”\nUthmeier, a former aide to and appointee of Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, acknowledged in public comments “some inconsistencies” created by the appeals court ruling. He said it was on lawmakers to fix them.\nBut neither Republican senate president Ben Albritton, or Florida house speaker Daniel Perez, who will determine the agenda for the Florida legislative session beginning in January, have so far made any statement about pursuing it.\nGrady Judd, the sheriff of Polk county and a vocal DeSantis supporter, said at a press conference this week that he had spoken to the two politicians and the governor’s chief of staff urging them to act quickly.\n“Open carry doesn’t mean open carry, every place in Florida,” he said. “We need to address through the legislative process tightening up the rules.”\nBob Gualtieri, the Pinellas county sheriff who chaired the commission investigating the Parkland shooting, said he would comply with the ruling, but issued a joint statement with police departments and other law enforcement agencies in his county highlighting the multitude of restrictions still in place.\n“We respect everyone’s second amendment rights, but ask that everyone please follow the law regarding the possession and carrying of guns in Pinellas county,” the statement said.\nThe confusion extends to both firearms control activists and gun rights advocates.\nNick Suplina, senior vice-president of law and policy at the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, condemned Uthmeier for endorsing the ruling.\n“Open carry escalates tensions, has repeatedly been used by extremists as an intimidation tactic, and introduces ambiguity into moments of crisis that make it harder for law enforcement to do their jobs,” he said.\n“Rather than prioritizing the safety of Floridians, attorney general Uthmeier handed extremists a win by pushing for more guns in more places, like concerts, polling places, and churches. If more guns made us safer, America would be the safest nation in the world. Instead, thanks to weak gun laws and actions … the US has 26 times the gun homicide rate of our peers.”\nThe gun rights group Florida Carry Inc, meanwhile, is urging gun owners to exercise caution and not automatically assume that the ruling authorizes unrestricted open carry, despite Uthmeier’s “law of the state” declaration.\n“There is going to be a brief period of time here where obviously the statutes have not caught up to the court rulings,” Sean Caranna, the group’s executive director, told the News Service of Florida.\n“We’re advising that sometimes discretion is the better part of valor and people should abide by the current set of places that are prohibited … when it comes to all forms of carry.”\nA Florida State University criminologist, Gary Kleck, an expert on gun control, said he doubted there was a strong desire in the state legislature to act.\n“There’s a solid Republican majority that is opposed to any restrictions on firearms,” he said.\n“I’m generally a skeptic on the impact of laws and public policies on human behavior, and I don’t think there’s a lot of open carrying anyway, even if it is legally permitted.\n“What really rules is informal social norms. It stands out and puts you in an embarrassing position to be openly carrying a firearm. People stare at you as if you might be the next potential mass shooter.\n“The traditional common law distinction way back at the founding of the Republic was that good guys were perfectly willing to openly carry. They had nothing to be ashamed of, and carrying a sword, a dirk, or a firearm openly was perfectly fine because it shows: ‘I have no evil intentions that I’m concealing,’ whereas concealed carrying was something for highwaymen, robbers and criminals.\n“So there were severe restrictions on concealed carry and hardly any on open carrying at the founding of the US. Whether or not you should be following 1789 traditions in 2025 is a pretty debatable issue.”\n"

    "body": "Switching your current account can get you some “free money” that you can use to boost your savings.\nSome big names have offers aimed at encouraging people to defect to them. As well as a cash payment, they are also offering access to their best-paying savings accounts.\nHowever, you need to read the small print: they have different requirements about things such as how much you must pay in, and some are paid-for accounts. Be careful so you do not end up signing up for something that will cost you more than you gain.\nThe bank is offering £175 to new customers who switch their main current account to it. You can open a Select or Reward account – the former is NatWest’s “basic everyday bank account” with no monthly fee, while the latter lets you get money back on your everyday spend but has a monthly fee of £2. Having a NatWest bank account gives you access to a regular savings account paying up to 5.5%.\nBritain’s biggest building society will pay you £175 if you switch to one of its three main current accounts. Two of these – FlexAccount and FlexDirect – do not have a monthly fee. Having a current account with the society means you get access to the Flex Regular Saver, which pays up to 6.5% in interest.\nThere is a market-leading £200 for people who switch to one of its Club Lloyds accounts or a Lloyds Premier account. The basic Club Lloyds account has a £5 monthly fee but this is refunded each month you pay in £2,000 or more. (The bank’s Classic account, with no monthly fee for anyone, is not included in the switch offer.) You get access to the Club Lloyds Monthly Saver account paying 6.25%.\nThe branchless bank, which is owned by HSBC, is offering £175 to those who switch to its 1st Account. You get access to a regular savings account paying 7% a year. If you can afford to put away the maximum of £300 a month for the year you will earn about £136.50 in interest.\nThe bank, which boasts a “unique customer-led ethical policy”, will give you £100 for switching to its standard current account. You get an extra £25 a month for up to three months if you actively use the account – so that’s a total of up to £175 up for grabs. Having a current account with the bank gives you access to a regular savings account paying 7% annual interest on deposits between £1 and £250 a month.\nIn all cases you have to fully switch an existing current account from another provider using the industry’s Current Account Switch Service. To do this you need to choose your new bank and apply then ask it to organise the transfer."

    "body": "Labour will seek an “ambitious” youth mobility scheme with the EU, allowing thousands of young Europeans to temporarily live and work in the UK, Rachel Reeves has said.\nThe chancellor told the Times the scheme would be “good for the economy, good for growth and good for business”, but stopped short of specifying who would be eligible.\nA scheme that would allow hundreds of thousands of 18- to 30-year-olds from EU countries to live and work in the UK, and vice versa, has been a key European demand in reaching an economic deal with Britain.\nReeves said the exchange scheme would allow “young people in Britain to be able to go and work, to travel, to volunteer, to gain experience, to learn languages in European countries”.\n“And we want young people from those European countries to also be able to come to the UK and have the same opportunities that my generation had to travel, work and study in Europe,” she said.\nThe chancellor also called on the Office for Budget Responsibility to “score both the improved trade relationships that we’ve negotiated and this youth experience scheme” in its economic forecasts.\nReeves’s remarks come in the lead-up to Labour’s annual party conference this weekend, as well as her crunch November budget, in which she faces the prospect of having to find up to £30bn in tax rises or spending cuts.\nDespite the bleak financial outlook in the run-up to the budget, the chancellor ruled out the option of a wealth tax. “If you look around the world, and countries that do have wealth taxes, they tend not to have other taxes, like inheritance tax and capital gains tax,” she said.\n“Those taxes bring in a large amount to the UK exchequer, and I don’t want to risk the revenues from those with an experiment on something different.”\nShe also hit back at economic proposals laid out by Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, who has been touted as a potential successor to Keir Starmer.\nBurnham said the UK should not be “in hock” to bond markets as he outlined measures that he believed a Labour government should pursue, including a big council housebuilding programme and the nationalisation of utilities paid for with a rise in taxes on the higher paid, a charge on expensive London homes and £40bn of extra borrowing.\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\nReeves likened the proposals to those espoused by Liz Truss, whose term as prime minister ended after her catastrophic “mini-budget”.\n“The government then took a huge gamble, an experiment on the British economy,” Reeves said. “And as a result interest rates went through the roof, mortgage costs went through the roof. Pensions were put in peril. The cost of government borrowing shot up too.”\nWhile admitting she would like to be “less in hock to bond markets”, she added that “the reality is that we rely on those bond markets and those people participating in them to buy our debt”.\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, Burnham argued that his remarks on bond markets had been “deliberately misinterpreted”. He said: “This is about a long-term approach to regaining stronger public control of essential services, re-establishing a tighter grip on the public finances and reassuring the markets.”"

    "body": "A trio of early stories by Virginia Woolf which together form a spoof biography of a family friend have been rediscovered and are set to be published next month.\nThe Life of Violet was inspired by Mary Violet Dickinson, who befriended the English writer when she was 20 and would go on to read many of her early writings, introduce her to one of her first editors and a wide circle of aristocratic friends, and look after her following a breakdown in 1904.\nThe stories are satirical, fantastical and perhaps surprisingly comic. Kaleidoscopic in plot and setting, they move from aristocratic antics in a grand Jacobean house in Hertfordshire to a bedtime tale of two goddesses who arrive in “Tokio”, Japan, on the back of a whale.\nThe mock biography was drafted in 1907, years before Woolf’s first novel appeared in 1915, and the writer – then called Virginia Stephen – did not, at least initially, want them to be seen. Sending a draft to Dickinson, she demanded that her subject and another friend, Nelly, be “the only readers”. To Nelly, she insisted: “dont quote it – see my vanity! And dont show it: I cant remember now how bad it is; but I know it will have to be re-written in six months; and I shant do it”.\nBut in fact she did return to fix the stories, we now know, thanks to a chance discovery of a revised manuscript, hidden away in a stately home for 80 years. Woolf scholar Urmila Seshagiri, a professor at the University of Tennessee, was in search of an unpublished memoir that Dickinson had written about Woolf’s childhood. She asked Longleat House, the Elizabethan home in Wiltshire where a collection of Dickinson’s papers are kept, whether they had it. Their response “bewildered” Seshagiri. Yes, they had the “Memoir of the Stephen Family”, but would she also like to see “Friendships Gallery”, an original Woolf typescript, hand-corrected by the author?\nSeshagiri knew that the original version of Friendships Gallery, Woolf’s largely ignored trio of short stories about her friend, was in the New York Public Library (NYPL), so she told Longleat they must just have a copy of them. “No no, we have an original document by Virginia Woolf,” they responded. So what was in it? Soon Covid threw a spanner in the works: because of international copyright law, Longleat couldn’t scan the text, or even show it via a video call, so it ended up being a “multi-year mystery”. Finally, in 2022, Seshagiri bagged an invite to the house.\nThe archivist led her into a reading room and handed her a cream-coloured box. She lifted the lid, hands shaking, and opened the volume. There, professionally typed, were revised versions of the NYPL stories, with hundreds of stylistic changes. While seemingly minor, the edits, made in 1908, prove Woolf took the stories more seriously than anyone had realised. “It’s the kind of moment that you never think you’re going to have as a workaday scholar,” says Seshagiri.\nNext month, Seshagiri’s discoveries will be published by Princeton University Press under a new title, The Life of Violet. The Woolf we know is present in these stories. The “fantastical imagination that produced Orlando” – the 1928 mock biography inspired by Woolf’s friend and lover Vita Sackville-West – is “in full flower already”, says Mark Hussey, author of Mrs Dalloway: A Biography of a Novel. In one passage, a goddess “clapped its jaws as fast as it could like ivory castanets, and the wild Cherry tree shook her blossoms and chimed as though each pink flower was a silver bell”. In another, “her ladyship waved her fan as an elephant its trunk”.\nIn the second story, The Magic Garden, the seed of the phrase “a room of one’s own”, the title of Woolf’s landmark feminist 1929 essay, is unveiled:\n“Do you know it seems to me – well don’t you think Violet – it would be very nice ---- ”\n“To have a cottage of one’s own? Yes, my good woman,” cried Violet.\nViolet’s proclamation is “the beginning of the great revolution which is making England a very different place from what it was”, Woolf goes on to write.\nSeshagiri sees these previously “invisible” stories as “quite radical”. In the third, set in Japan and inspired by a round-the-world trip taken by Dickinson and Nelly, Woolf imagines an “advanced and radically egalitarian” two-deity society, writes the scholar in an afterword. While Woolf’s cultural ignorance and orientalism are apparent in characters named “chin-chin”, “Rick-Shi” and “Rim-Shi-Ki” – which are, writes Seshagiri, “meant to sound exotic”, she observes a clear throughline between the utopian visions of The Life of Violet and Three Guineas, the author’s 1938 polemic on patriarchy and fascism in which Woolf imagines a collective of women committed to attaining “justice and equality and liberty”.\nIn this way, The Life of Violet “shows us a Woolf who might have been”, suggests Seshagiri. “A fabulist unmaking patriarchy’s cultural inheritances through enchanting, surreal impossibilities rather than philosophy or history.”\nGiven all they tell us about Woolf, how have these stories flown under the radar for so long? In 1955, Dickinson’s family offered the early, unrevised NYPL versions to Leonard Woolf, whom Virginia married in 1912. Leonard, perhaps swayed by Woolf’s initial shyness about the stories, declined to purchase the works, deeming them unworthy of publishing. The stories then wound up in a London junk shop, and were bought for a shilling by Booker prize founder Tom Maschler. He showed them to Francis Wyndham (who would go on to edit VS Naipaul and Jean Rhys), who pointed out what Maschler had failed to realise: the author “Virginia Stephen” was Virginia Woolf.\nLeonard was approached again for permission to publish, but maintained that the stories were “a kind of private joke, and not very good” (Woolf’s sister, Vanessa Bell, on the other hand, found them “very witty and brilliant”). They ended up housed in the NYPL, and have since been repeatedly overlooked by scholars and editors of anthologies of Woolf’s short fiction.\nWoolf’s edits between the 1907 NYPL version and the newly discovered 1908 version affect “the rhythm of the sentences, something Woolf was always very concerned with”, says Hussey. In some cases, she incorporates Dickinson’s handwritten pointers: while Woolf initially wrote that Violet “shrieked” the line about the cottage; the edit to “cried” on her friend’s suggestion adds profundity, says Seshagiri.\nThe scholar’s discovery shows that Woolf did not, as was long assumed, forget about this early work, Hussey says, “but returned to it with a seriousness of purpose, editing and revising it in such detail because she herself took it seriously as an experiment in the development of her own fictional style.”\nQuotes used with permission of the Society of Authors as the Literary Representative of the Estate of Virginia Woolf"

    "body": "The City regulator is facing a battle with claims companies over a £1m advertising campaign designed to discourage drivers from using their services to get payouts over the car loan scandal.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced this month that it would roll out a series of online and radio adverts, telling drivers they will not need to use claims management companies (CMCs) or law firms to apply for their share of the regulator’s proposed £18bn compensation scheme.\nThe scheme is meant to compensate millions of drivers who were overcharged as a result of controversial commission arrangements between lenders and car dealers. It follows a supreme court ruling in August, which upheld one of three consumer complaints over commission.\nThe regulator has hired online influencers including Cameron “Cazza” Smith to tell consumers they will be able to apply for free, and should not sign up to claims companies that take up to 30% of payouts in fees.\nHowever, claims firms are accusing the FCA of caving to big banks – which are trying to reduce their compensation bill – and ultimately pushing consumers towards accepting “low-ball” payouts.\nThe FCA has said borrowers should expect no more than £950 for each complaint through its scheme.\n“We have consistently called for a redress scheme that is fair, transparent, and puts consumers first,” said Darren Smith, the managing director of Courmacs Legal, a Blackburn-based law firm that says it is handling 4m car finance claims.\n“Instead, the FCA appear to be prioritising the interests of big banks by pressuring victims to accept low-ball offers through their redress scheme that may not reflect the full extent of the harm they have suffered. Motorists should have a choice to engage lawyers, especially if they might get a significantly higher payout through the courts.”\nLizzy Comley, the chief operating officer of the claims law firm Slater and Gordon, said she was “concerned the FCA’s campaign risks undermining the important role law firms play in protecting the rights of consumers”, particularly vulnerable borrowers who may have trouble lodging complaints themselves.\nWhen asked whether it was considering taking any legal action over the advertising campaign, another firm, Bott and Co, said: “We are currently reviewing the content of the campaign to ensure its message is fair and balanced and accurately reflects the complexities involved. All options remain under review to protect the integrity of our profession.”\nCMCs and law firms have been in a long-running battle with the banking industry, having gained a reputation as ambulance chasers before hitting their stride after the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal. High street banks alleged that CMCs had fuelled a claims culture in Britain, filing reams of spurious claims and taking advantage of consumers who could easily have filed complaints on their own.\nThe City watchdog raised concerns this summer about “troubling” practices by some claims firms, saying their marketing – which have flooded social media – risked misleading consumers over the motor finance scandal, and even leaving them out of pocket.\nSign up to Business Today\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nBut Bobby Dean, a Liberal Democrat MP and member of the Treasury committee, said he was worried that the FCA’s advertising campaign risked tarnishing all claims companies with the same brush. “Let’s not forget that, without the work of some credible law firms, much of the unfair practices that consumers will be due compensation for would never have been uncovered,” he said.\nAn FCA spokesperson said: “Only around half of consumers know they don’t need to use a CMC or law firm to claim. It’s important they’re equipped to make a choice and to understand that they could lose some of their compensation. That’s what our consumer campaign aims to do. Get people the facts so they can make their choice.”\nLenders have made provisions to cover the costs of potential compensation. Lloyds, the largest provider of motor loans through its Black Horse division, has already put aside a total of £1.2bn for potential compensation, while Santander UK has allocated £295m.\nThe specialist lender Close Brothers has so far put aside £165m, while FirstRand, which owns the UK car lender MotoNovo, has taken a £122m charge. The financial arm of BMW has put aside £200m to date."

    "body": "Immigrants locked up in California’s newest federal detention center have described the facility as a “a torture chamber”, “a zoo” and “hell on earth”, saying they were confined in filthy cells and suffered medical crises without help.\nSix people detained at the California City detention center, which opened in late August and is now the state’s largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center, shared accounts with the Guardian of poor conditions and alleged mistreatment by staff.\nThe detention center is located in a desert region 100 miles (160km) north-east of Los Angeles, on the grounds of a state prison that closed in March 2024. CoreCivic, the private prison corporation, re-opened the facility as an Ice detention center as the Trump administration has pushed to rapidly expand immigration detention capacity. Advocates argued the process was rushed, and city officials said CoreCivic is operating the facility unlawfully without the required permits.\nThe detainees, who are fighting deportation, said they have struggled to access hygiene and cleaning supplies, and lack adequate food and medications, and that officers have threatened solitary confinement and physical force over minor issues or after they spoke up.\n“This place is built to break us,” said Sokhean Keo, a California City detainee who is facing deportation to Cambodia and refused to eat for several days last week to protest conditions. “There is nothing but harassment and torture here. It’s inhumane, unsanitary and a health hazard every single day … Please, please help us, please.”\nIn interviews over the last two weeks, California City detainees have claimed:\nstaff were not consistently giving people daily medications, and some detainees fell unconscious due to health issues;\nsome toilets and sinks were backed up or not functioning properly, creating a stench;\ndetainees were left to clean their own cells, but not given proper supplies;\ndetainees were confined to cells for hours, and when they were allowed outdoors, it was sometimes only for 30 minutes a day in a dusty area with nothing to do;\nsmall food portions left people hungry, with some saying they rationed meals and feared the water they were drinking was dirty.\nBrian Todd, a CoreCivic spokesperson, said in an email that CoreCivic’s on-site healthcare team “takes seriously their role and responsibility to provide high-quality healthcare, available 24/7”, and that initial delays in providing medications after people transferred to the facility have been resolved. He said toilets “are maintained in proper working condition”. He also said the company had “submitted all required information for the business license and continues to maintain open lines of communication with city officials”.\nAs part of the dramatic surge in immigration enforcement, the Trump administration has allotted $45bn to increase the capacity of Ice detention centers – with the ultimate goal of holding more than 100,000 people. Already, the number of detainees has hit record highs this summer.\nPart of that plan involves boosting capacity in places like California City – and quickly.\nCoreCivic, which operates dozens of prisons and detention facilities across the US, reached a $13.5m agreement with Ice in April to convert what was previously a 2,560-bed prison in California City.\nThe detention facility is situated in a remote, sprawling town in the Mojave desert that experiences scorching-hot summers and cold winters. More than 500 detainees were housed there as of early September, according to the local mayor who visited, and the site has increased Ice’s detention capacity in California by 36%.\nOversight of Ice detention centers has generally been limited, so often lawyers and families rely on the accounts of detained residents and government officials who do get tours.\nDetainees brought to California City in recent weeks said they had been abruptly transferred from other Ice facilities in the state and that staff seemed ill-prepared for the influx.\n“Some officers expressed they weren’t ready for the population to come in,” said Alfredo Parada Calderon, who has been in Ice detention for nearly two years and is facing deportation to El Salvador. “It’s a major mess. They didn’t have nothing to give us.”\nParada said he initially received just one set of socks and underwear and wore the same clothes for nearly a week while washing undergarments in his sink. A small soap bar supposed to last a week was insufficient, he said. His cell was freezing cold, with bedding not thick enough to keep him warm, and lights were on 24/7, making sleeping difficult, he said.\nFood was served cold and portions were small, so at times he would save a piece of bread for later: “People go hungry in here,” he said.\nFernando, another detainee, who asked to go by a nickname out of fear of retaliation from staff and Ice, said that even when he saved all three daily meals to eat at once, it barely fit one plate: “The servings are just enough to keep us from starving.”\nOscar, a detainee who asked not to use his full name because he also fears retaliation, said one officer told the detainees to drink unfiltered sink water that appeared cloudy and dirty: “This place has been shut down. Who knows what is in the pipes? She was so persistent, this is the water you get.” Eventually, he said, the officer brought them different water in jugs, though he feared that water was also dirty.\nIce facilities typically have law libraries and some books available, but California City has no reading materials or resources for people working on their cases, Parada added.\nJon, a detainee who requested to go by a pseudonym out of fear of retaliation, said when he arrived, the toilet in his cell was filled with feces and other toilets weren’t working. “Everything is dirty,” he said. He said he cleaned his cell using his own soap, shampoo and towel, and at one point detainees were given two buckets of water, two brooms and mops and told to clean a dorm housing roughly 90 people.\n“Would you let your own family live in these conditions?” Parada said. “It’s unethical. It’s irresponsible. It’s unkind.”\nTodd, the CoreCivic spokesperson, said “any claim of water quality issues is patently false”, saying residents get the same water supply provided to the surrounding community. When detainees arrive, the facility provides “clean clothing”, toiletries including soap and shampoo, and blankets and “staff will reissue supplies and clothing as needed”, he said. Todd added that detainees have access to law library computers in their housing areas.\nIn addition to the lack of supplies and dirty conditions, detainees described cruel and humiliating behavior by some staff members.\nSome officers were running the site as if it were a correctional facility and treating residents like criminals, even though they are accused only of civil immigration violations, said Parada: “We have to keep reminding them that we are detainees, not prisoners. We are civilians. They treat us like a bunch of animals.”\n“The treatment is very unprofessional and military-like,” added Oscar, who said some staff appeared to be training on the job due to the rushed opening: “They shout: ‘Get in your cells! Lockup! Count time! Walk in a single-file line!’ It’s very aggressive, like we’re in a military bootcamp.”\nDetainees said staff frequently did seven “counts” a day, where residents are required to return to their cells so officers can count them one-by-one. The procedure can leave residents locked up for hours. Parada said there were days when he spent 20 hours in his cell.\nKeo recounted one incident where several men were exercising in a common area, since there is minimal outdoor time and no recreational or exercise equipment. The men took off their shirts in the heat, which can climb above 100F (37.7C) in the region, prompting an officer to order them to put their shirts on. When the men objected, the officer threatened to pepper-spray them, place them on lockdown for days or send them to “the hole”, referring to solitary confinement, he said: “They like to power trip and show their authority.”\nJon said he they first arrived, staff threw out many of the detainees’ personal belongings and conducted aggressive searches that involved touching their genitals. “They said: ‘Get your hands on the wall and spread your legs,’” he recalled. “People were saying: ‘Why are you touching me and holding onto my thing?’ And they said: ‘It’s procedure. If you don’t like it, too bad.’”\nDuring a lengthy intake process, Jon said, detainees had to raise their hands if they needed to use the bathroom: “It was so degrading.”\nHe also said he witnessed an older detainee ask an officer if he could have an extra tray of food that was sitting uneaten. The staffer said no and threw it away in front of him, he recalled: “I think that’s evil.”\nJon and Keo both said staff photographed their tattoos and questioned them about possible gang ties, and threatened them with “the hole” if they didn’t comply with questioning.\nTodd, of CoreCivic, said staff receive six weeks of training, which “includes preparing for and responding to critical incidents”, and that “many” have previous experience “working in secure facilities”. He did not comment on the alleged incidents outlined by the detained residents, but said when detainees are transferred from other facilities, open commissary items are thrown out.\nDetainees said poor healthcare was their most urgent concern.\nOne asylum seeker inside California City, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution, said he has been in Ice detention for more than a year and has been awaiting surgery for months. He said he can barely walk, and after he was transferred from another facility to California City, his requests for a wheelchair were repeatedly ignored.\n“The day we got transferred was a disaster,” he said. “Many times, I requested a wheelchair and medical care. They just kept saying you have to walk. I was in pain. Nobody listened to me. Nobody cares. As the days pass, my health condition is getting worse.”\nSeveral detainees said there were delays in getting medications, and Oscar said staff did not seem to communicate with their previous facilities about their prescriptions. Keo said staff threw away detainees’ medications during their transfers to California City, and staff have regularly delivered pills at strange hours of the night – sometimes after midnight.\nKeo said he had also witnessed two people collapse and need emergency care, leading to cries of “man down!” from detainees and guards.\nKeo said he required anxiety medication but was not given it at consistent times, and couldn’t ingest them in the middle of the night without food: “When I don’t get it, my heart starts beating really fast, my whole body starts sweating. It’s like I’m about to have a heart attack. I feel like I’m dying.” He was worried about people in the facility with diabetes not consistently getting their insulin.\nFernando said he takes psychiatric medications that help him sleep, but staff have at times delivered it at 3am. He also said he had been waiting more than two weeks to be seen by a doctor for thyroid issues and went three days without medications. While speaking by phone to an advocate, a nurse passed by, but did not answer his questions about when he would get the care he was requesting. “She refused to tell me anything and walked away,” he said, adding that he feared he would not receive proper treatment. “They’re just going to let me die in here.”\nFernando said he saw a detainee who appeared to have mental health issues banging on his door but not getting help. The detainee later attempted suicide and became unconscious, he said.\nTodd, of CoreCivic, confirmed there was a suicide attempt on 9 September, and that the detainee was hospitalized. He said the healthcare team follows medical care standards established by the company and government partners; that residents have “daily access” to sign up for care, including mental health services; and that prescribed medications are either managed by healthcare staff “or by the individuals themselves”. Nurses “promptly inform the ordering physician when renewals are required”, he continued, adding that no recent hospital visits were due to residents not receiving prescribed medications.\n“All our facilities operate with a significant amount of oversight and accountability, including being monitored by federal officials on a daily basis, to ensure an appropriate standard of living and care for every individual,” he said.\nAn Ice spokesperson declined to comment, referring the Guardian to CoreCivic.\nImmigrants’ rights groups have fought to shutter the California City detention center since its opening.\nMarquette Hawkins, California City mayor, said on Thursday that CoreCivic did not have the proper permits or business license to operate the facility and that its application is still pending. The city, he said, was exploring options to address the violations, including possible fines. He said the city did not get notice from the company that detainees were moving in, which he learned from advocates: “I was a little bit taken aback and disappointed.”\nGrisel Ruiz, senior managing attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a non-profit, said that in addition to its lack of permits and license, CoreCivic had also bypassed state law requiring that the city provide an opportunity for public input and advanced notice before opening a new Ice detention facility: “For them to totally disregard local municipal law and state law should alarm everybody.”\nAnti-Ice protesters began gathering outside the facility when news spread of its opening and recent city council meetings have been packed with residents from across the region objecting to the detention center, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nHawkins said he believes local residents “see the benefit to any industry being here providing jobs”. He toured the facility for roughly two hours in early September and said it appeared clean and that staff were “operating with a high level of professionalism”. He said he saw one person on suicide watch and another on a gurney being treated for a medical issue.\nThe California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice (CCIJ), a group supporting detainees, said last Thursday that more than 100 detainees had taken steps to protest their alleged mistreatment, including organizing sit-ins and hunger strikes. Officers responded with lockdowns, which restricted telephone access, sent some people to solitary confinement and, in at least one area, threatened force, CCIJ said.\nTodd contested the use of the term “solitary confinement” and said that when CoreCivic isolates residents, it places them in what it calls “restrictive housing units”. Last Thursday, Todd said, a group of detainees “briefly refused to comply with a directive to return to their living areas”, but “subsequently chose to return to their cells without the need for further action”. Seven of them were placed in restrictive units “pending an investigation”, he said.\nDetained people were protesting and risking retaliation because they are desperate for intervention, said Priya Arvind Patel, CCIJ supervising attorney: “People are sick and really, really scared something bad is going to happen, and no one is going to care.”\nSome detainees said they were, for the first time, considering accepting deportation.\n“I just want a fair chance to stay here and fight my case,” said Keo. “My family wants me to stay, but I’m tired … I think of quitting every single day I’m here. In my country, it’s bad right now, very bad. But there is nothing worse than this. This place is hell on earth and we need to get out.”"

We eke out the last dregs of summer until one day we realise that we are still carrying sunglasses around, when what the weather actually calls for is a scarf. At which point, it is time to focus on what will be the most important piece in all of our wardrobes for the next six months – the coat.\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\nA good coat is much more than an extra layer. It is the piece that sets the tone for your whole outfit. It is the hardest-working player in your wardrobe, the one that you turn to day in and day out, the piece that has to coordinate with everything else you wear, the garment that needs to be tough enough to cope with being pulled on and off multiple times a day.\nThe right one will make it easier to get through winter with a smile on your face. Picture a cold, rainy Tuesday morning commute. Now imagine yourself striding along in a fluffy leopard-print jacket, or a glossy emerald puffer, or a debonair maxi coat in cherry-coloured wool. Exactly.\nLet’s say you have decided that last year’s coat just doesn’t cut it and are in the market for a new one. The best strategy is to tick off the practical requirements first, then go with what makes your heart sing. A coat is a major investment, so do not settle for one that does not both keep you warm and make you happy.\nStart with the basics. Do you mostly walk, cycle or travel by car? Do you carry an umbrella, or do you need a hood? If you wear smart dresses to work, then a long coat will protect them while you are outside; if you are mostly in jeans, a warm jacket works.\nWith those guardrails in place, find a coat that elevates your look. For half of the year, the coat you wear becomes, if not your whole personality, then at least your first impression. So when you pick one, you make a statement about yourself to the world.\nA bright coat can be a smart choice, because it adds impact to simple outfits. When you try one on, tune in to how it makes you feel about yourself when you look in the mirror. If you feel emboldened, go for it. But if you feel awkward or embarrassed, pass and move on to something navy or camel or grey. This coat should make you feel brave and happy and competent and warm – and warm inside.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/27/starmer-asks-conservative-peer-write-planning-bill-block-judicial-reviews",
    "body": "Keir Starmer has tasked a Conservative peer with writing a new planning bill to remove the ability for environmental groups to delay projects such as Heathrow’s third runway with judicial reviews.\nThe Guardian understands that leaving the Aarhus convention is being discussed as an option. This is an international treaty signed up to by the EU and other countries in Europe, which protects the right for campaigners to bring legal claims against large infrastructure projects such as waste plants, nuclear power stations and motorways.\nDoing this would “destabilise Britain’s constitution” and silence legitimate objections, leading planning lawyers have warned.\nThe chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has put Heathrow expansion at the heart of her push for economic growth, claiming it would make the UK “the world’s best-connected place to do business”. The Treasury sees the new bill – including blocking what one source close to Reeves called “stupid” judicial review cases for nationally significant infrastructure projects – as essential to ensuring work can start on a new runway before the next general election.\nReeves has repeatedly complained that the protection of “bats and newts” has interfered with the UK’s ability to complete major infrastructure projects. She has also insisted that pursuing economic growth must trump Labour’s net zero commitments, saying “growth underpins everything else”.\nStarmer and Reeves earlier this year introduced a planning bill to parliament that would override EU-derived environmental protections and put important wildlife sites at risk of development. After campaigns by activists and MPs, the government added amendments that gave some extra protections for nature. But ministers still believe deregulation has not gone far enough.\nCharles Banner KC has been asked by the prime minister to find a way to remove the cap on costs for groups bringing a judicial review. He has previously worked on human rights cases with Starmer, and is considered an expert on judicial reviews. He has worked on cases involving Heathrow and Stansted airports, as well as Thames Water’s Abingdon reservoir.\nThe Aarhus convention, signed in 1998, enshrines the right for citizens to challenge environmental decisions and defend their right to a healthy environment, including by capping the legal costs a losing claimant can be forced to pay. Individual claimants only have to pay £5,000, while groups such as Friends of the Earth have to pay £10,000.\nLord Banner, who was made a peer by the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak, last year, has said it would be impossible to remove these cost caps without leaving Aarhus. He wrote in a review that: “For so long as the UK remains a member of the Aarhus convention, there is no case for amending the rules in relation to cost caps in order to reduce the number of challenges to nationally significant infrastructure projects.” The provisions ministers want to include in the bill would make leaving Aarhus a requirement, as they would contravene the convention.\nThe new bill aims to speed up large projects, particularly Heathrow. The airport has submitted a timeline to the government claiming it could begin building the controversial third runway by the next general election if there are no judicial reviews.\nThinktanks and lobbyists have also put pressure on the government to stop these decisions being subject to the convention.\nBritain Remade, a pro-growth thinktank that is close to No 10, has been campaigning for the convention to be looked at again.\nSam Dumitriu, its head of policy, recently wrote on his blog that the government could “scrap the [cost] caps altogether and treat environmental lawsuits like any other”. The centre-right thinktank Onward this week published a paper including a recommendation to bring primary legislation to remove the cost caps under the Aarhus convention.\nBanner confirmed to the Guardian that he is working on the planning changes, but declined to comment further.\nSign up to Down to Earth\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\nafter newsletter promotion\nAlexa Culver, a leading planning lawyer, warned against weakening rights to bring legal cases against projects such as Heathrow. She said: “Judicial review is an essential protection against government overreach. It ensures that authorities’ decisions are made rationally, within legal powers and with fairness and proper procedure. Dismantling these protections to usher in unlawful and harmful development, for example, or to silence particular sections of the public, will distort the constitutional balance of power and fundamentally undermine public trust.\n“An alternative to destabilising our constitution would be delivering lawful infrastructure projects which demonstrate an obvious, clear, engaging vision, purpose and use case. Any judicial review claims brought that are totally without merit should be thrown out, as they currently are.”\nNiall Toru, a senior lawyer at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government is trying to have it both ways – promising that airport runways will only be approved if they meet strict legal obligations on climate and air quality, while simultaneously working behind closed doors to gag those who could hold them accountable to those promises. Instead of silencing opposition by leaving a vital treaty that enables judicial scrutiny, the government should focus on developing infrastructure that communities actually want and need.”\nA Heathrow spokesperson said: “We have submitted a proposal that will deliver the UK’s gateway to growth in line with the government’s timing if the right policy framework, including on planning reform, is put in place by ministers.”\nA government spokesperson said: “We are legislating in the planning and infrastructure bill to prevent meritless claims against nationally significant infrastructure projects from being dragged through numerous appeals in the court, ensuring there can only be one attempt at legal challenge if the court considers a case to be totally without merit. We are also working with the judiciary to ensure challenges against these major infrastructure projects are dealt with more quickly and efficiently, and will keep the process under review.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "body": "It has taken barely two weeks for Donald Trump to turn the horrific killing of Charlie Kirk to his political advantage, unleashing an unprecedented peacetime assault on free speech and a free press on the back of the assassination.\nSince Kirk’s death, the president and his top team have:\nforced a private media company to suspend late-night TV star Jimmy Kimmel for inaccurate comments he made about Kirk’s suspected shooter;\nthreatened other TV networks with losing their licences should they say things Trump doesn’t like;\nvowed to prosecute “hate speech” that is fully protected under the first amendment;\ndeclared antifa a terrorist organisation in an indiscriminate attack on political ideology;\nand told journalists covering the Pentagon that they will have their access revoked unless they agree to restrictions on their reporting.\nThat’s a far cry from the promise Trump made on the first day of his new presidency.\nOn 20 January, hours after he had been sworn in as 47th president, Trump sat at his desk in the Oval Office and applied his distinctive signature to executive order 14149 – Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship.\nThe order pronounced that government censorship of speech was “intolerable in a free society”. It promised that under Trump’s watch, no federal official would engage in any conduct that would “unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen”.\nIt was a bold pledge to return America to the values of free speech and expression enshrined in the first amendment of the US constitution. But for some observers following events that day, the executive order was to be taken with a large pinch of salt.\n“I knew at the moment that the ink was not even dry, that executive order 14149 was a load of BS,” said Matt Welch, editor-at-large of the libertarian magazine Reason. “I knew it would not last.”\nDespite the administration’s rush to censorship as a result of Kirk’s killing, Trump has so far enjoyed almost complete support from the Republican party and his wider “Make America great again” (Maga) movement. Relatively few voices from the right of American politics have cried foul.\nBut those voices are pointed, and in the longer term potentially critically important. Many of them subscribe to libertarianism, with its emphasis on individual rights, civil liberties and limited government. Or as Reason puts it, devotion to “free minds and free markets”.\nOther free speech critics have raised their voices from the wider conservative movement, while a few brave souls have even spoken out against Trump from within the Republican party. Collectively, they articulate a conservative and libertarian critique of Trump’s second presidency that, given that it comes nominally from his own side, may carry some weight with the president as he proceeds to pulverise constitutional norms.\nTheir presence – lonely though at times it may seem – underlines that Trump and his Maga army have not yet secured an absolute monopoly of thought on the right. As guardians of free speech trying to hold back an increasingly authoritarian tide, they can also offer tentative clues as to how American conservatism might one day claw its way back from Maga’s iron grip.\nBut for now they remain engaged in a long, uphill battle. “We are locked in a type of memetic combat,” Welch said. “We’re standing on the sidelines trying to get their attention, telling them that each new development is making it worse, and they are not listening at all.”\nRightwing thinktanks have been central to Trump’s second presidency. The Heritage Foundation presented him with the blueprint for his incendiary return to office: the 920-page Project 2025.\nAmerica First Legal, founded by the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, has provided legal ballast for many of Trump’s key ambitions. They include tearing down diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and initiating mass deportations.\nBut as Trump has begun aggrandising his own power and wielding it against his opponents, a separate heavyweight thinktank, the libertarian Cato Institute, has emerged as a thorn in the president’s side.\nInitially, Cato’s belief in small government and deregulation led it to show enthusiastic support for the Maga agenda.\nWithin 48 hours of Trump’s second inauguration, the thinktank had flagged up 22 of his predecessor Joe Biden’s executive orders including several countering the climate crisis and enhancing healthcare, all of which Trump dutifully revoked. It also offered its own blueprint, in this case a manual for Elon Musk and his demolition crew, the “department of government efficiency”, that was so well received that Rolling Stone dubbed Cato “Doge’s unofficial think tank”.\nMore recently, however, Trump’s egregiously unconstitutional assault on the first amendment has goaded Cato into speaking out as a rare but influential adversary on the right. Thomas Berry, Cato’s director of constitutional studies, told the Guardian that several of Trump’s recent actions had offended one of the institute’s most fundamental values.\n“When government officials use the power of the state either to suppress speech or tilt the free marketplace of ideas, that’s incredibly dangerous in the long term. It places a core restriction on individual liberty – the right to say what you want and say what you believe,” he said.\nCato began objecting to Trump’s authoritarian tendencies well before Kirk’s death. In June the thinktank joined a coalition of groups in filing an amicus brief supporting Harvard in its lawsuit against the Trump administration after billions of federal dollars were withheld from the university ostensibly as punishment for its failure to combat antisemitism.\nCato also expressed concern about Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, students from Columbia and Tufts universities respectively, whom the administration tried to deport after their public criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza. Berry called the administration’s yanking of Harvard funding and the student immigration actions “core infringements on academic freedom and speech”.\nHe also denounced Trump’s executive order last month vowing to prosecute anyone burning the American flag. As he pointed out, “there is ironclad legal precedent that flag burning is protected speech.”\nSince Kirk’s killing, Berry has watched the unfolding of Trump’s “free speech for me, but not for thee” response with mounting alarm. Disney’s temporary cancellation of Kimmel’s late-night show for misrepresenting the Kirk suspect as a Maga supporter after threats of government penalties from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), was in Berry’s estimation a clear example of “government power being used to suppress speech that the administration doesn’t like”.\nThen there was the intervention of Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, who days after Kirk’s death vowed to prosecute hate speech. Like flag burning, hate speech is fully protected under the first amendment, as the country’s top law enforcement official ideally should have known.\nIronically, Kirk himself was clear on this point, saying last year: “Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There’s ugly speech. There’s gross speech. There’s evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the first amendment.”\nBerry also regards as a free speech violation Trump’s threats to go against leftwing groups he dislikes. On Monday the president designated antifa a “domestic terrorist organization”, a move that potentially breaches the first amendment by criminalising political ideology.\nAll of these quick-fire steps after Kirk’s assassination towards controlling public discourse leaves Berry profoundly apprehensive. “I’m very worried about what the executive branch is trying to do,” he said.\nIn particular, the Cato director is concerned about what he calls the “capitulation factor”. He fears that private companies such as Disney, ABC’s owner that suspended Kimmel for six days before the comic was allowed back on air on Tuesday, will settle with Trump rather than stand up for constitutional rights.\n“Long term, we’ll get through this,” Berry said. “But in the short term a lot of speech is going to be chilled without ever getting into court, and that’s very, very bad.”\nOpposition to the assault on free speech goes beyond the libertarian right. Other prominent public figures from conservative and libertarian circles have spoken out, indicating fissures that, should they grow, could challenge Trump’s Maga hegemony.\nBari Weiss, a rising star on the anti-woke right who is being reportedly groomed for a top job at CBS, has castigated the president in her online outlet, the Free Press. In an editorial, the site decried Trump’s many threats against media organisations as a “case where the medicine is worse than the disease”.\nIn Congress, senator Ted Cruz, normally a reliable Trump acolyte, warned the president to avoid habitually bullying media companies. If he did, it would “end up bad for conservatives”.\nThomas Massie, a Republican congressman from Kentucky who has led the charge to have the Epstein files released, compared Bondi’s threat to prosecute hate speech to George Orwell’s dystopian “thought crimes”.\nEven the Maga cheerleader Tucker Carlson cleared an episode of his online show to rail against the risk of hate speech laws being introduced in America. Were that to happen, Carlson said, then civil disobedience would be called for.\n“Because if they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think, there is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.”\nSo how did it come to this? How did Trump go from executive order 14149 to threatening an ABC reporter to his face last week that he might face prosecution “because you treat me so unfairly”?\nHow did JD Vance move from pledging in February that under Trump’s leadership “we may disagree with your views but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square”, to calling for a mass doxing of anyone who had celebrated Kirk’s murder?\nHow did the FCC chair Brendan Carr veer from having denounced in 2023 government censorship as the “authoritarian’s dream”, to using his federal power to force Kimmel’s suspension with the mob-like menace: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way?”\nEugene Volokh, a libertarian conservative who is a senior fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, has a word for the Trump team’s razor sharp U-turn on free speech. He calls it “censorship envy”.\n“It’s human nature to want to restrict speech that you disapprove of, to retaliate,” he said. “People are motivated by censorship envy – the idea that the other side got to suppress speech they disliked, so I should jump on the bandwagon and get some of that action too.”\nVolokh added that in his opinion Trump’s get-you-back censorship was a mistake. “It’s bad for the country. It’s bad for the conservative movement.”\nThat admonition was echoed by Sabrina Schaeffer, a member of the executive team of the R Street Institute, which preaches classical liberalism, individual liberty and free markets. She said that she has been scratching her head over the past few days as so many Republicans applauded the clampdown on free speech.\n“I know they’re tired of ‘woke’ politics. But this should be a cautionary tale, because one day Democrats will hold the levers of power again and then they will be even more empowered to shut down dissenting views.”\nWelch, who regards his strain of libertarianism as neither of the right nor left, sees the current moment against the long arch of history. Under Ronald Reagan, the Republican party was a broad church that combined conservatism with libertarian activism, with free speech as one of its central tenets.\nWhat Trump has unleashed, by contrast, “is going against Reagan and 40 years of American politics. People are so addicted to power right now that they are throwing principles out the window.”\nIt was Republicans, Welch pointed out, that in the 1970s and 80s led the charge on free speech grounds against the FCC’s so-called fairness doctrine that required TV networks to carry opposing viewpoints on controversial public issues. That is a world away from the Republican chair of the FCC threatening a broadcast company over one comment from a comedian.\n“I care about the federal government telling a private broadcaster how they are supposed to conduct their business,” Welch said. “That’s crazy.”\nCato’s Berry is clearly disturbed by the turn of events, but he has not despaired. For him, the way out of this quagmire lies with the American judiciary and the first amendment itself, which he regards as the strongest safeguard of free speech in the world.\n“I remain confident that the courts will uphold the principles that the government cannot be biased, that it cannot chill speech through selective enforcement, that there is no law against hate speech.”\nAs for Welch, he draws comfort in the storm from a more amorphous source. He looks to the American spirit, and a characteristic within it that he believes has been integral since even before the country’s founding.\nThat is, the ability of Americans to trash each other.\n“We criticise, always have done,” he said. “We have just always been kind of assholes, cheeky.”\nWelch sees the portrayal of Trump in the latest season of the animated sitcom South Park as a seamless continuation of this trait. The president is depicted as a censorship-addicted dictator sleeping with the devil.\nThat gives Welch hope.\n“I feel like the South Park in all of us will eventually win,” he said. “It’s the natural place for us to be, and by the time Trump finally goes, he’ll find himself on the losing end.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "body": "El Mango viewpoint on Isla Isabela, the least populated island of the Galápagos archipelago, offers panoramic views of lush mangroves and crystalline shores. But this idyllic spot was also the setting for the darkest of crimes.\n“My daughter was 15 when a man without scruples or feelings did this thing to her,” said Carmen Torres, sitting at the kitchen table in a small house on the outskirts of the island’s main village, her eyes cast downwards to the floor. “He knew what he was doing. But these are children, and they are so vulnerable to manipulation,” she said.\nLast year, Carmen’s daughter and two of her school friends were drugged and taken to El Mango, where just a short walk from the viewpoint, the undergrowth is littered with dirty mattresses and discarded condoms. All three girls were sexually abused and raped.\nEcuador’s Galápagos Islands are a protected national park and Unesco World Heritage site, whose rich, unusual fauna played a pivotal role in Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. It is a haven for wildlife, but for the human population of some 33,000 – and especially the women and girls among them – it is not a place of safety.\nA 2019 report by the UN notes “obvious tension between the image projected of the Galápagos as a destination … with an emphasis on nature conservation … versus the socioeconomic barriers and needs experienced by its inhabitants, particularly women”.\nTorres was afraid to speak publicly about her daughter’s case, and asked to use a pseudonym because the island has a population of 2,000, and everyone knows one another. Since she and her daughter reported the assault to authorities, they have received threats, bullying and harassment from other islanders. Torres was accused of being a bad mother, while her daughter was dismissed as a prostitute and drug addict.\n“There are so many girls that don’t speak out because [they fear] the violence they will face for doing so,” said Torres.\nTwo of the girls attacked at El Mango reported the crime to the police. When local authorities failed to take action, they sought help from a local activist group, Magma. Together with international anti-sex-trafficking organisation Our Rescue, they arranged for the girls to be taken to a safe-house in the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where they are receiving support and protection while the case remains under investigation.\nSince it was founded in 2020, Magma – a small team composed of a handful of volunteers – has supported more than 100 cases of gender-based violence across the Galápagos archipelago. In 2022, they urged authorities to act after a 12-year-old gave birth in Santa Cruz, the most populous island.\n“There was no criminal report,” said María Casafont, one of Magma’s founders. “The protection system in the Galápagos is nonexistent.”\nThe activists say that what happened to Torres’s daughter follows a pattern they have seen before, suggesting evidence of a child-trafficking ring.\n“It seems to be the modus operandi of a group of men who capture girls, rape them and extort them for sex, photos and videos,” said Marcela Santillana, another member of of the group.\nThe organisation calculates that gender violence accounts for 25% of all reported crimes on the Galápagos, but only 5% of sexual violence cases result in a conviction. The real number scale of problem is believed to be much higher as very few crimes are actually reported, said Santillana. “People don’t trust the system,” she said.\nMeanwhile, many more resources are dedicated to pursuing environmental offences, which account for less than 1% of reported crimes.\n“There’s a systematic problem with the police and prosecutor’s office,” said Albert de la Huerta, Our Rescue’s the Latin America director of operations. Prosecutors from mainland Ecuador are only deployed to the islands for short periods, and the constant rotation causes delays and eventual dismissal of crimes, he said.\n“By the time they get knowledge of the islands, they’re leaving. I think it’s set up that way because everyone wants to protect the image of the Galápagos,” said De la Huerta, who said the Galápagos was one of Latin America’s worst “hot spots” for child trafficking.\nThe islands’ remoteness adds to the problem, said de la Huerta. “Everybody’s scared that if they talk, something will happen to them. So no one wants to file a criminal report, and the police can’t do anything”.\nEcuador’s Women’s Ministry and Tourism Ministry both said in statements that they recognise the pressing issue of gender violence, citing specialised training for public officials, and technical assistance to improve institutional responses to cases.\nThe public prosecutor’s office told the Guardian that a work plan has been established to address sexual violence on the islands, which includes setting up a Gesell chamber (a child-friendly interview room with a one-way mirror) on Santa Cruz to record sensitive testimonies from children.\nThe prosecutors office said that high staff turnover was a result of strict population control measures in the Galápagos, where residency is limited to five years for public officials. However, they did not address allegations that some prosecutors serve for as little as 30 days, nor outline any plans for urgent needs, such as setting up a forensic lab for evidence collection or shelters for abuse survivors, which currently do not exist on the archipelago.\n“Another animal health laboratory has opened for DNA analysis of iguanas and ticks,” said Casafont. “But for people? Nothing.”\nSome of the Galápagos islands’ youngest residents have decided to take matters into their own hands. One friend of the girls who were raped in El Mango, organised a protest to demand greater support from prosecution services.\n“I don’t want other girls to be afraid to report abuse,” said the teenage girl, who has also been subjected to sexual harassment, and plans to leave the island as she finishes school to escape the island’s unbearable misogyny and abuse.\n“I would stay and fight, but this community is very toxic,” she says. “When I leave, I won’t ever come back.”\nMeanwhile, Torres has not seen her daughter for months: she is still in the Quito safe-house as the investigation drags on. “We want the girls to come home, but not until justice has been served and their attacker is behind bars.”"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/government-shutdown-explainer",
    "body": "The federal government is once again on the brink of a shutdown, unless Congress can reach a funding agreement before the start of the new fiscal year, on 1 October.\nWith the clock ticking and both Democrats and Republicans seemingly dug in, there is little time left to avoid a lapse in federal funding. And in a sharp escalation of how past shutdowns have worked, the White House has instructed agencies to make plans for permanent mass layoffs in programs poised to lose funding.\nIf a deal isn’t reached by midnight on 30 September, parts of the government will begin shutting down. Without that money, many parts of the government cannot operate and federal agencies are forced to cease all non-essential functions until Congress acts.\nWith both chambers narrowly divided and deeply polarized, shutdown threats have become a feature of Washington’s budget battles. A standoff in 2018, during Trump’s first term, resulted in a 34-day shutdown, the longest in the modern era. At the time, roughly 800,000 of the federal government’s 2.1 million employees were sidelined without pay.\nThe federal government’s new fiscal year begins on 1 October, and Congress has yet to strike an agreement on a short-term funding bill.\nDonald Trump canceled talks with Democratic congressional leaders earlier this week, saying a sit-down would not be “productive” and assailing their demands as “unserious”. The move infuriated the Democrats, with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries blaming the president and congressional Republicans, who control both chambers, for a possible shutdown.\nThe Senate last week rejected competing stopgap measures to avert a shutdown, after the Republican-controlled House narrowly passed a funding bill with all but one Democrat opposed.\nCongressional Democrats are under pressure to use their leverage to stand up to Trump and his administration. In March, Schumer lent the necessary Democratic votes to approve a short-term funding, Republican-written measure without securing any concessions – a move that infuriated the party’s base.\nIn exchange for their votes in the Senate, Democrats are demanding an extension of subsidies that limit the cost of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and are set to expire, a rollback of Medicaid cuts made in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and the restoration of funding to public media that was cut in the rescissions package.\nIn an interview on CNN, Senate majority leader John Thune called Democrats’ healthcare demands “completely unhinged and unreasonable and unserious”.\n“If they want to have a serious conversation, I think that I’m sure the president would be welcome or would be happy to do that,” he added.\nSchumer shot back on X: “What’s ‘unserious’ is ignoring the 93% spike for health insurance coming to Americans on November 1.”\nThis time, the impact on federal workers could be even more severe. In a memo released on Wednesday, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget told agencies not just to prepare for temporary furloughs but for permanent layoffs in the event of a shutdown.\nThe memo directed agencies to ready reduction in force notices for federal programs whose funding sources would lapse in the event of a shutdown and are “not consistent with the president’s priorities”.\nOMB led the administration’s earlier efforts to shrink the federal workforce as part of a broader government efficiency campaign led by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”.\nIn a statement on Thursday, AFL-CIO’s president, Liz Shuler, said government employees had “already suffered immensely” this year under the Trump administration’s vast cuts to the federal workforce. “They are not pawns for the president’s political games,” she said.\nAsked about the memo on Thursday, Trump blamed Democrats, saying a shutdown was what the party wanted. “They never change,” he said.\nAt a news conference, Jeffries said on Thursday that Democrats “will not be intimidated” by the Trump administration’s threats to fire more federal employees if the federal government shuts down. He added that his message to Russell Vought, the head of OMB, was simple: “Get lost.”\nIn the event of a full or partial government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal workers may be furloughed or required to work without pay. Operations deemed essential – such as social security, military duties, immigration enforcement, and air traffic control – continue, but other services may be disrupted or delayed. Mail delivery and post office operations will continue without interruption.\nThe effect can be wide-ranging and long-lasting. Previous shutdowns have closed national parks and the Smithsonian museums in Washington; slowed air travel; delayed food safety inspections and postponed immigration hearings.\nWhile the broader economy may not feel the effects immediately, analysts warn that a prolonged shutdown could slow growth, disrupt markets, and erode public trust."

    "title": "Democrats race to embrace swearing and angry comebacks – but will it work?",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/democrats-anger-swearing",
    "body": "Democrats want your attention, and they’re done asking politely.\nSeveral months into Donald Trump’s second term, presidential aspirants, members of Congress and party officials are abandoning carefully calibrated messaging in favor of gut-level rhetoric that is angrier, rawer and unapologetically more profane.\n“Things are really fucked up right now,” Democratic congressman Robert Garcia said in a TikTok video with the influencer known as the Regina George liberal, who has built a following demanding Democrats get meaner.\nWith party approval ratings at decade-lows and their base increasingly alarmed by what they fear is America’s authoritarian slide, Democrats are racing to revamp how they talk – and how they resist.\nDemocrats’ wider embrace of swearing, trolling and scorched-earth comebacks is part of a broader mission to sound more like “normal people” and less like a party of poll-tested talking points and white papers. From campaign rallies to TikTok vent seshes, the characteristically buttoned-up Democrats are taking more risks – and punching back harder at Trump and his administration.\n“This is not the Democratic party of your grandfather,” Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), declared earlier this year. “This is a new Democratic party. We’re bringing a knife to a knife fight.”\nThere is widespread agreement among soul-searching Democrats that they have an authenticity problem.\n“We are tired of being seen as weak and out of touch, and are really trying to make the point that it’s some bullshit that the Republican party and all the big corporations that support them continue to try to frame us as [such],” said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic party and head of the DNC’s association of state Democratic parties.\nThe party has hemorrhaged rural and working-class voters for years. But in 2024, Democrats also saw worrying drops in support among Black and Latino voters as well as young people – becoming a party increasingly confined to the coasts, major metros and college towns.\nAfter losing to Trump, again, fundraising has slumped and Democrats now lag far behind Republicans in voter registration. Since November, several leading Democrats, including California governor Gavin Newsom, have described the party’s brand as “toxic”.\nDemocrats have many theories as to how it got so bad – but they keep circling back to the most basic political skill: communication.\nCritics say risk-averse party elders – valued more for their fundraising prowess than their digital fluency – failed to adapt to the tectonic shifts in media consumption. Democrats anodyne messaging, they argue, might have made the evening news, but it was too easily drowned out by the right’s online surround sound, turbocharged to amplify Trump and his Magaworld allies.\n“A message that nobody hears cannot persuade them,” Anat Shenker-Osorio, veteran Democratic strategist and communications researcher who has convened hundreds of focus groups with American voters. “If you keep producing blandly unobjectionable 100-word statements … then it truly does not matter what you are saying because literally no one’s gonna hear it.”\nThe bigger challenge, Shenker-Osorio notes, is that Democrats aren’t just competing for eyeballs with Republicans — they’re up against an algorithm that prizes outrage and emotion, whether it’s Maga memes or Taylor and Travis engagement headlines.\nMonths into Trump’s second term, buoyed by a string of off-cycle election wins and a revved up base, Democrats are experimenting more. More members of Congress are on TikTok and heeding advice to adopt platforms like Twitch and Snapchat. They’ve jumped on viral trends and livestreamed hot takes stepping off the chamber floor. They’re also venturing into less friendly terrain, yakking it up on “manosphere” podcasts or launching their own.\nPete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary and a possible 2028 presidential contender, was an early evangelist of the go-everywhere style. He appeared on Fox News when many Democrats refused to sit down with Trump’s favorite network hosts. In April, he sat for a nearly three-hour interview on the podcast Flagrant, covering everything from White Lotus to “Trump Tariffs, Taxing Billionaires, and Republican Gays”.\nThe push for a more free-wheeling style hasn’t slowed the circulation of polling memos and strategy briefs coaching Democrats on how to be more free-wheeling. There has been reams of guidance on what to say (Trump’s takeover of DC is a “distraction” from his market-rattling tariffs and Medicaid cuts, for example) and also what not to say (words like birthing person, BIPOC).\nRepublicans have sneered at Democrats’ newfound brashness, deriding the effort as “desperate” and “Maga cosplay”. Comparatively, the White House’s social media strategy seems designed to shock. In a July post on X, its official account wrote: “Nowhere in the Constitution does it say we can’t post banger memes.”\nDemocrats accept that some attempts will be cringe. In February, an unfortunate turn-of-phrase at a rally alongside federal workers became a cautionary tale.\n“I don’t swear in public very well,” first-term congresswoman Maxine Dexter of Oregon warned before throwing caution to the wind and declaring: “We have to fuck Trump!”\nThe crowd cheered. “You said it!” an audience member shouted encouragingly. But the remark was dragged online, with Politico observing that it “landed less like a diss and more like a proposition”.\nBut the stakes have grown far more serious.\nIn the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination this month, Trump’s White House has led a clampdown on political speech, threatening to punish left-leaning figures and groups it accuses of spreading hateful rhetoric.\nAt a rally in North Carolina this week, vice president JD Vance, who once feared Trump could be “America’s Hitler,” urged Americans to abandon such rhetoric: “If you want stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you is a Nazi.”\nElected Democrats were near-universal in their condemnation of political violence, which has targeted officials in both parties. But that hasn’t stopped Trump and other prominent Republicans from casting blame on the left. “I hate my opponent,” Trump said, speaking at Kirk’s memorial.\nIn a widely circulated exchange, a reporter asked progressive Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren for her response to calls on Democrats to “lower the temperature”.\n“Oh, please,” Warren replied. “Why don’t you start with the president of the United States?”\nFor years, Democrats took Michelle Obama’s “go high” mantra as gospel.\nIn 2018, when Barack Obama’s former attorney general Eric Holder reinterpreted the refrain, suggesting that “when they go low, we kick them,” he was rebuked by Michelle Obama herself and also by Trump – despite his own long record of disparaging and even threatening language. Earlier that year, Trump asked lawmakers why the US should accept immigrants from “shithole countries” in Africa rather than from places like Norway.\nSeven years later, Trump is still heaving expletives and insults from the bully pulpit. But this time, Democrats are far less reticent to respond.\n“If we’re serious that Trump is a threat to the fundamental values of our country and a threat to democracy, then we have to use these tactics and be real fighters,” Kleeb said.\nSign up to Headlines US\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nYet, as Democrats fight to break through Trump’s unfiltered media dominance, there is deep frustration among their base that the party’s leadership is not doing enough to stop him - no matter how tough they talk. In Washington, out-of-power Democrats are under pressure to use the little leverage they have in a looming government shutdown showdown with Republicans.\nMeanwhile, some of the fiercest resistance is coming from the states. In August, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum needed to vote on a brazen, Trump-sought plan to redraw its political maps in the middle of the decade. Though Republicans ultimately approved a new map carved up in their favor, the Democrats’ quorum-breaking gambit helped trigger a response from governors like Newsom in California, whose Trump 2.0-era mantra now is: “fight fire with fire.”\nIn recent months, Newsom has matched his combative posture with a pugnacious social media persona, a mimicry of Trump’s all-caps bombast. The governor’s team now regularly trolls the president, posting with a cadence that mirrors the right-wing outrage machine they mock, blasting out lengthy rants, AI-generated taunts, even the occasional Spanish-language vulgarity.\n“I’m sick of being weak,” Newsom said on a podcast in August, adding: “We’re going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.”\nIn a full-circle moment, Holder, a longtime champion of clean maps, threw his support behind California’sretaliatory gerrymander.\nLorena Gonzalez, the salty-tongued leader of the influential California Labor Federation, said the appetite for a no-holds-barred approach is strong.\n“People are frustrated. We’re frustrated,” she said. “So we’re fighting back – and the language, I think, mirrors the frustration and the urgency.”\nAt a rally launching California’s redistricting campaign, Gonzalez rendered a blunt verdict on Trump’s presidency: “We tell our members who believed him, it’s okay. He fucking lied.” The crowd roared, and she repeated the bit. Handing the mic to the next speaker, Gonzalez grinned: “I’ve exceeded my number of fucks today.”\n\nMore and more Democrats argue that the real divide in their party isn’t between the ideological left and center, but between the fighters and the so-called “folders”. And the so-called fighters tend to be the angriest.\nAmong the most prolific Democratic swearers were Representatives Eric Swalwell of California, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Jasmine Crockett or Texas, all younger progressives, according to a Washington Post analysis of social media posts, podcasts and other public statements by politicians. Among party officials, Kleeb topped the list. Overall, it found that Democrats cursed far more frequently than Republicans in the months following Trump’s return to the White House.\n“I do cuss but I’m just passionate,” Crockett said in an interview last month. “I don’t imagine myself saying, ‘Trump is trying to be a dictator,’ and then sitting quietly. No. If I say it, I mean it.”\nA former trial attorney, Crockett said language can help build trust. “I never had the benefit of putting on a facade,” she said. “You’ve got to build a rapport quickly, and the best way to do that is to be authentically who you are.”\nResearch suggests that swearing can make a speaker seem more honest and sincere –though voters are quick to detect a false note.\n“Swearing as a tactic is dumb,” said Lis Smith, a veteran Democratic strategist known for her bluntness. Her advice: “Just be normal. Don’t use weird lefty academic jargon. Don’t dismiss people’s real concerns about things like crime by citing stats and data. And don’t think that the key to coming across as authentic is dropping four letter words that you don’t use normally.”\nAs younger Democrats rise through the ranks, an “extremely online” vernacular has crept into the party’s messaging – snarky, irreverent and tailor-made to go viral.\nEarlier this year, Garcia brought a poster of Elon Musk to a Congressional hearing in a stunt he called a “dick pic”. In June, House Democrats elected Garcia to serve as ranking member on the influential House oversight committee – the first time in 100 years a second-term congressman was elevated to the role.\nThe DNC has also sharpened its trolling game, with edgy posts, including one suggesting the Secretary of Defense was “tweeting while drunk” and another taunting White House aide Stephen Miller with a crude “cuck-chair” meme. They’ve also seized on right-wing anger over the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein case, breathlessly boosting calls for Republicans to “release the files”.\nAt the party’s summer meeting, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the former vice-presidential nominee with a “Midwest nice” reputation, took a juvenile jab at Trump’s chronic venous insufficiency, mocking his “fat ankles”.\n“Petty as hell,” Walz admitted, as the room erupted in cheers.\nYet for those who fear authoritarian drift, trolls and clap backs can seem woefully insufficient in the face of Trump’s mass deportation campaign or his deployment of federal troops to American cities.\nRidicule, Shenker-Osorio argues, can be a powerful tactic, but only as part of a broader resistance. “Taking the piss out of the strongman is a really critical part of fighting authoritarianism,” she said.\nStill, she cautioned: “Rhetoric without action is nothing. If anything, it just makes voters more frustrated.”\nDavid Smith contributed to this story from Washington"

Today, the area is undergoing redevelopment, so I wanted to show part of that process.”\nOkada defines the theme of her street images as “sites of miracles that the city has overlooked”. Editing on this shot was minimal. “I don’t want to create painterly beauty; rather, share the small wonders that exist alongside our everyday lives,” she says.\nIt was the first day back after the summer holiday break and the heat was intense, so there was nobody sitting on the benches along the street, but she spotted one lone worker. “Their work is tough – they must continue no matter the weather, but I think he was almost at the end of his shift.”\nReflecting on her photo now, she adds, “I love how you can discover many layers in a single frame, and how nature and manmade come together.”"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/26/kido-nursery-hackers-radiant-threaten-publish-children-profiles",
    "body": "Hackers with pictures and the private information of thousands of nursery children have threatened to publish more material online unless they are paid.\nCriminals calling themselves Radiant hacked the UK-based Kido nursery chain and posted profiles of 10 children online on Thursday. Their website on the dark web has posted a “data leakage roadmap” that sets out how the “next steps for us will be to release 30 more profiles of each child and 100 employees’ private data”.\nAccording to a cybersecurity industry briefing seen by the Guardian, Radiant appears to be a new group within cybercrime circles that is “testing the boundaries of morality and depravation”.\nThe group’s online posts show a proficient command of English but there are indications that they may be non-western, such as a “slight awkwardness” in phrasing, the analysis notes.\nIt further states that the Radiant gang’s “leak site” – a common ransomware tactic in which a victim’s data is displayed on the dark web – contains 10 Kido customer profiles, which include the child’s name, date of birth, birthplace and details of parents, grandparents and guardians including addresses and phone numbers.\nThe site also claims to have sensitive data on more than 8,000 children and their families, including accident and safeguarding reports, as well as billing. It says all Kido nurseries in the UK were affected.\nThe leak site cites attempts to negotiate with Kido and carries a threat to “ruin their entire company as we slowly leak and we urge them to continue our dialog[ue]”.\nA Kido spokesperson said: “We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them.”\nThe nursery chain is working with authorities including the Information Commissioner’s Office and Ofsted, and the Metropolitan police is investigating.\nAn email seen by the Guardian from Kido UK’s chief executive, Catherine Stoneman, said it was treating the incident “with the highest priority”, including engaging independent IT forensic experts in a “complex” and potentially time-consuming investigation. She attributed the breach to “two third-party systems used to process certain data”.\nShe wrote: “Where we have confirmed that a family’s information has been affected, the family will have already been contacted. If you have not received individual correspondence from us, that means we have no forensic evidence that your data has been impacted.”\nKido, which has 18 sites around London, with more in the US, India and China, told parents the breach happened when criminals accessed their data hosted by a software service called Famly, which is widely used by nurseries to share photos and information with parents.\nAnders Laustsen, the chief executive of Famly, said: “We have conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and can confirm that there has been no breach of Famly’s security or infrastructure in any way and no other customers have been affected. We of course take data security and privacy extremely seriously at Famly.”\nOne woman told the BBC she had received a threatening phone call from the criminals, who said they would post her child’s information online unless she put pressure on Kido to pay a ransom.\nSean, whose child is at a Kido nursery in Tooting, south-west London, told the Guardian that he and all the parents he knew had not heard directly from the nursery that their child’s data had been compromised, though they remained apprehensive. “How have they got details on just certain kids and not everyone – that’s the bit that’s not making loads of sense,” he added.\nHe viewed the cyber-attack as an inherent risk of using any app, and considered the opportunity to gain real-time information on his child, such as what they had eaten, worth it. Sean said he felt sorry for the nursery staff who were “getting the brunt of complaints”, when it was the app provider that needed to explain itself.\n“One of the things that’s obviously horrifying is that whoever the people are, they are sinking to new depths trying to extort money out of a nursery and holding children to ransom,” he said.\nThe police advise companies against paying hacker ransoms as it fuels the criminal ecosystem as cyber-attacks become increasingly widespread.\nNotable recent victims include the Co-op, Marks & Spencer and Jaguar Land Rover, with many hacks attributed to an English-speaking cybercriminal community known as Scattered Spider.\nThe M&S hack deployed ransomware, a tactic popular with Russian-speaking cyber gangs involving software that locks up a target’s IT systems.\nThe BBC has held conversations with the criminals through the messaging app Signal and learned that although they spoke fluent English, they said it was not their first language and claimed they hired people to make the calls.\nThe criminals said: “We do it for money, not for anything other than money. I’m aware we are criminals. This isn’t my first time and will not be my last time.”\nThey added that they would not be targeting preschools again as the attention had been too great."

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/27/the-cars-band-book-let-the-stories-be-told",
    "body": "In 1984, at the peak of the Cars’ power as a hit-making band, drummer David Robinson was the one who always made the greatest effort to meet and greet their fans. In several telling encounters, however, things went quickly south after it became clear many of those fans didn’t have the slightest idea who he was. “What makes you think I’m not in the band?” he would ask them, with increasing frustration. “If you’re in the Cars, then why aren’t you in the videos?” they’d say.\nEven ardent followers of the Cars could be forgiven for not noticing that he actually was. In the clip for their 1984 smash single Magic, for instance, Robinson, as well as most of the other band members, appear for just 30 seconds, squeezed into a small corner of the screen. In the video for the Cars’ biggest hit, the worldwide smash Drive, Robinson and most of the others, only appear towards the end – as lifeless mannequins. Meanwhile, in the Magic clip the camera dotes on leader Ric Ocasek obsessively, while in Drive, Ocasek gets a whole backstory despite the fact that bassist/vocalist Ben Orr is the guy who actually sings the song.\n“With the Cars, Ric always had to be the one out front, calling the shots,” said Bill Janovitz, who has written the first authoritative book on the band, aptly titled Let the Stories Be Told. “One reason I wrote the book was so people could understand everything the other guys did to make the Cars the great band that it was.”\nIn the process, Janovitz not only revealed the imbalanced dynamics that mar many major bands, but also the troubling mix of fear and insecurity that defined Ocasek’s darker side. Janovitz did so with the full cooperation of the surviving three members, including guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and Robinson who, besides playing drums, also designed much of the band’s visual presentation. Janovitz never had the chance to speak to the two members who have died, one under tragic circumstances, the other under a cloud of bitterness. Orr, the group’s sex symbol and most flexible singer, died of pancreatic cancer at 53 in 2000. Ocasek, who wrote and sang the vast majority of the band’s songs, died in 2019 at 75 from heart-related issues. The latter’s death made tabloid headlines when it came to light that he had cut out of his will some of his children as well as his famous wife, the model Paulina Porizkova. Though the division of funds in Ocasek’s will was actually a bit more nuanced than that, the last-minute changes he made to his estate had a vindictive edge that left a rancid taste in the mouths of some key survivors.\nIn his book, Janovitz worked hard to balance the brilliance of the band’s music with the issues that sparked rancor in their ranks. Easton and Robinson think he achieved that. “There are some rough parts to it,” Easton admitted, “but I think he told a true story.”\n“Let’s just say that nobody is painted any worse they actually were,” Robinson said with a laugh.\nThe most positive legacy of the band is the music itself. During their imperial years, between 1978 and 84, the Cars sold nearly 25m albums in the US alone, driven by eight top 20 hits, including top five smashes like Shake It Up and Drive. Their debut single, My Best Friend’s Girl, broke the British top five with a fresh and clever style that presaged what would become a signature electro-pop sound of the 80s. To Janovitz, “it was a sound that seemed both old and new at the same time.”\nKey parts of the older aspects came from Easton’s guitar. “I added a lot of the rock’n’roll elements,” Easton said. “Every song had a hook, a little solo break and an interesting intro and outro.”\nAt the same time, the Cars’ records drew on the arty drones of the Velvet Underground and the sinister sputter of the art-synth band Suicide. Other parts of the Cars’ music had an incredibly specific influence – namely, the mid-section breakdown in Roxy Music’s debut single from 1971, Virginia Plain. Even so, they updated it with their own quirky hooks and the unique sheen of Roy Thomas Baker’s production. “Roy didn’t mess with the music or add parts to the songs,” Easton said. “He was more into the sonics, which made us sound great in the studio and gave us that massive background vocal sound.”\nJanovitz provides forensic detail on the construction of those songs, but he’s just as thorough in covering the personal demons the members faced, especially their controlling, self-involved and secretive leader. Many of Ocasek’s issues can be traced to his troubled childhood in Cleveland. His mother was an alcoholic, and his father would beat him. A gawky kid, he was also taunted and often excluded by his peers. “Ric himself often said in interviews that he needed to be in such control because he was bullied not only by his parents but by other kids,” Janovitz said. “In every band he was in, you see him taking control as opposed to letting things happen with the other members.”\n“A large component of Ric’s personality was insecurity,” Easton said. “It was like he believed someone was trying to take something from him.”\nOcasek also had a troubled romantic relationship early on, having married when he was 18 to a high-school girlfriend mainly because she had gotten pregnant. They had two children before Ocasek abandoned them to pursue a career in music. An expert compartmentalizer, Ocasek told few people about his first wife and kids. Even the other band members didn’t know until years later. “Ric would dole out information on a need-to-know basis,” Janovitz said.\nHis ambition to ditch domestic life for stardom ramped up after he met Orr, whose smoldering good looks and sweet voice offered a useful contrast to Ocasek’s awkward appearance and rangier singing. “He knew they could form a great partnership, balancing the dark and the light, the edgy and the smooth,” Janovitz said.\nIn the early 70s, the two moved their nascent band to Boston, drawn by both its large student population and the fact that its music venues had the distinction of encouraging original material from new acts. They formed the Cars in 1976 with members who each had a healthy amount of prior experience in bands as well as distinct musical tastes. “Unlike a lot of bands who met in high school as friends and who all had the same record collection, we were five very different people,” said Easton. “I think that’s a big part of what made the Cars unique.”\nNot only did they have a notable disparity in their tastes but also in their ages; Ocasek was nine years older than Easton, something the band leader worked hard to hide from the press – for good reason. When the Cars’ debut album came out in 1978, Ocasek was already 34, putting him in the age range of 1960s rockers such as Mick Jagger who were, by then, considered the old guard. That could be a major problem for a group being marketed as part of a new wave. By that point, Ocasek had also begun losing his hair and wore a wig, something he barely mentioned to anyone. To Janovitz, that was part of a cycle of denial. “The lying begets the insecurity, which begets more lies,” he said.\nRegardless, the Cars broke big almost immediately, selling over 6m copies of their self-titled debut while earning the title of best new artist in a Rolling Stone readers’ poll over emerging stars as vaunted as Elvis Costello and the Clash. Unfortunately, their success only seemed to fuel Ocasek’s need to claim all the credit. He was abetted by Elliot Roberts, the band’s powerful manager, who treated most of the other members as expendable. “Elliot separated Ric from us,” Robinson said. “If there was important information to be shared, he would only tell Ric.”\nRoberts’ choice to focus solely on Ocasek enabled the band leader to try to replace Robinson at one point, a move staved off only after the drummer made a pleading case for himself. Over time, Ocasek became just as disillusioned with Easton, whose playing he considered too rooted in the past. His critiques could prove wounding. “It was kind of a ‘hot and cold’ thing,” Easton said. “I thought we were really tight, then something would happen, and he would shine me on.”\nRoberts put no muscle behind any of the other members’ solo projects, and, in some cases, prevented them from taking outside session projects that would have boosted their personal profile. The result limited their income, as did Ocasek’s reluctance to tour as the years went on, something only he could fully afford to do since he had nearly all the publishing credits and, so, the big royalty checks. The fact Ocasek rarely shared any portion of the credits with the other members frustrated some of them. Though he did write the core of most every song, “the demos he brought to us were extremely skeletal,” Easton said. “What the band brought to them – the different motifs and grooves and hooks – was the meat that hung on those bones.”\n“Ric brought us a ‘Ric song’,” Robinson said. “But we made it a ‘Cars song’.”\nThough Ocasek felt closest to Orr, the member he knew the longest, eventually he became jealous of his sex appeal and began to put him down and severely limit his input in the recordings. That exacerbated Orr’s growing alcoholism, which progressed to such an alarming degree that at one point he allegedly threatened to kill himself and his then girlfriend, saying, “This ship’s going down, and I’m taking you with me,” according to Janovitz’s reporting.\nOver time, Ocasek’s personal life became problematic as well. He dumped his second wife, with whom he had two children, nearly as abruptly as he had his first spouse and their kids. He did so to be with Porizkova, who was less than half his age: she was then 19 to his 40. At the time, one of his kids was older than she was. As obsessed as he initially was with her beauty, he grew tired of her, leading to sexual affairs. Porizkova told Janovitz that Ocasek withdrew from her sexually years before his death, but he still wanted her to remain devoted. She remained so, nursing him when he became sick in his later years. Regardless, he accused her of abandoning him – his greatest fear.\nEven so, Porizkova was surprised when Ocasek left the grand majority of his estate to his two youngest sons, minus 20% for the middle two kids. Not a cent was given to his first two. An earlier version of the will had given all the kids equal amounts, with plenty left over for Porizkova. Though she did inherit the Gramercy Park townhouse they shared, which later sold for $9m, Ocasek’s catalogue was the real prize. After his death, it sold for $45m.\nDespite the more troubling issues the band faced, Easton said he’s anything but bitter, stressing, too, that he retains great love and respect for their leader. For that reason, he hopes the more difficult parts of the Cars’ story won’t taint their legacy. Certainly it didn’t dampen Janovitz’s respect for them. Still, the author admits that, for all his exhaustive reporting of the Cars’ story, Ocasek remained elusive to him. “I’m sure I didn’t get the whole of him,” Janovitz said. “Ric always wanted to be an enigma. In the end, that’s just what he was.”\nLet the Stories by Told is out on 30 September"

    "title": "Most of gen Z watch TV with the subtitles on – and I understand why | Isabel Brooks",
    "section": "Opinion",
    "publication_date": "2025-09-27T09:00:39Z",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/27/gen-z-watch-tv-subtitles-i-understand-why",
    "body": "I used to think there were two types of people: the ones who only use subtitles when necessary, and the unappreciative philistines who use them for no good reason. I was willing to die on this hill, arguing that they distracted from the purity of the audiovisual experience: the cinematographer’s attention to detail, the glimpse of a tear in an actor’s eye, the punchline of an expertly timed joke, and so on.\nBut I have been forced to recognise just how alone I am on this hill: in 2021, a survey found that 80% of 18-25-year-olds used subtitles all or some of the time, while a new survey run by streaming service U found that 87% of young Britons are using subtitles more than they used to. There is no longer a debate about subtitles: among my peers, “two types” of people have given way to “mostly one type”. (Meanwhile, the 2021 survey found that less than a quarter of boomers used subtitles, despite the latter generation experiencing more hearing difficulties overall.)\nWhy is this practice so common among people my age? If you aren’t hearing-impaired and are fluent in the language of the dialogue, what is it about subtitles that makes them more appealing?\nAn easy assumption is that this is the result of a short attention span, passivity and a lazy nature, a failure of generation Zombie. But having experienced watching TV with and without subtitles, I’d say the former doesn’t beget lazy viewing so much as a quicker information download. The new status quo of “subtitles on” among the young reflects both a values shift and cultural conditioning as a result of big tech’s ever-encroaching impact on our entertainment experience.\nFor example, the small screen in our living room has to share the limelight with the micro screen in our lap. The U survey revealed that 80% of gen Z and millennials “double-screen” when they watch. With subtitles on, I find myself being able to quickly gather what one character has said, look down at my phone, react to a message, then look up before that character has even finished their line. The viewing experience thus becomes multifaceted and efficient. The subtitles allow us to go on our phone but still absorb the content and gist of the TV show. Of course, that means they also function as mini-spoilers: when watching a comedy sketch recently, I found myself half-heartedly chuckling at a joke before it had left David Mitchell’s mouth – because I had already read it on the screen.\nI don’t need to use my little grey cells when watching most TV shows, but there are few, like Succession, where double-screening is a sad exercise. Even if I manage to successfully absorb each line in the script through reading, I’d be neglecting the exceptional acting. The same thing cannot be said for Love Island (although arguably the acting is of a high standard there, too).\nAnd social media itself has encouraged the use of subtitles across the board. It is now a given that most creators add text captions to their videos – without the option to turn them off. This cultural shift may explain the generational gap between boomers and younger viewers, the latter only appeased by rapid-fire content and videos with faster cuts, absorbing lightweight content at a higher speed, which text captions allow us to do.\nThis isn’t simply a trend but a feature anchored in the algorithm itself. Text captions, rather than dialogue, encourage the video to crop up in the TikTok search engine, increasing reach and visibility as well as viewer retention and viewing time. It began as an accessibility improvement, but the rapidity with which it has caught on suggests it’s business-oriented and crucial to getting that sweet algorithm boost. The fact that 85% of social media visual content is now watched on mute (while commuting, cooking, on the treadmill at the gym or in houseshares), coupled with the ease with which AI can generate subtitles without the need for human transcription, means we’re living in a subtitled world – one that is often poorly translated, low-quality and error-ridden.\nSeen this way, subtitles have been normalised as a result of our technology-infused lifestyle, rather than being something we have actively sought out or freely adopted. My flatmate, a keen TikToker, said she used to find subtitles distracting and annoying, then gradually started using them while watching TV. “I’ve felt very passive in it,” she said. “I don’t think I look at them most of the time.” Then why do you have the subtitles on, I asked. “I don’t know,” she said with a shrug.\nAmazingly, subtitles have not been linked to improvements in young people learning to read, although other studies have shown that they can improve comprehension of what happened in a given programme. Subtitles arguably keep us following more effectively than non-subtitles. Our TV habits are now influenced by a need for efficiency ported over from our social-media habits, which mean we can quickly glean the necessary content and then move on. In a 2023 survey, 40% of Americans cited “enhanced comprehension” as the main reason they use subtitles.\nI have to ask: are people now watching shows just to find out what happens, and to prove they’ve seen it? Since when did we finish work, sit down on the sofa, cuddle up and think “thank god, I can’t wait for a bit of comprehension tonight”? TV is supposed to be fun. Shouldn’t we be focused on enjoying it?\nIsabel Brooks is a freelance writer"

    "body": "When two brothers called Johannes and Johann Adam Birkenstock began making shoes in a tiny hamlet near Frankfurt in the 1770s, they could never have imagined what they were starting.\nHistory doesn’t record much about the first shoemaking Birkenstocks, who can be traced to a document written in 1774, the year after the Boston Tea Party. But 251 years, eight unbroken generations and many Johanns, Johanneses, Carls and Karls later, the company that emerged from that first family business has become one of the most rampagingly successful footwear brands on the planet.\nBirkenstock now sells tens of millions of pairs of shoes every year (they won’t say how many), giving the company a valuation of $7.5bn (£5.6bn) when it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2023. It has been a fashion and high street success story for decades, yet still seems to boast gravity-defying growth year after year; this week it announced projected growth of 17.5% on last year.\nSteve Jobs wore them in the 1970s, as did Kate Moss in her breakthrough 1990 shoot for the Face. They rose in the boho chic years, soared during Covid and were even given an extra bounce by the Barbie movie. The current big seller, the Boston clog, was hailed by British Vogue in April as the “shoe that has the fashion crowd in a chokehold” – yet in 2026 the Boston will mark 50 years, entirely unchanged, since it was first introduced.\nHow did a brand described even by some of its fans as the world’s ugliest shoe become one of the world’s most popular? Not by leaning into trends. “Fashion has never been our thing – neither then nor now,” the company’s CEO, Oliver Reichert, said recently, a bold choice of words from a man leading a global style brand. Instead, in perhaps the least sexy phrase ever uttered in fashion marketing, he said Birkenstock was a “purpose brand that’s rooted in orthopaedics”, which since its foundation had had an “unquenchable interest in foot health”.\nThis anti-fashion approach has long been part of the company’s shtick. It was Konrad Birkenstock, great-grandson of Johann Adam, who first introduced an orthopaedic shoe last in 1897, making waves by his bold suggestion that right and left feet should be shaped differently.\nCarl, his son, insisted that shoe retailers complete a training course before they were even allowed to stock the product; when Carl’s son Karl (told you …) launched the Original Birkenstock Footbed Sandal at Düsseldorf shoe fair in 1963, he got a wave of ridicule and not a single order. Renamed Madrid, that same single strap model remains one of the company’s core products.\n“We always start from the consumer and the benefit our products bring to their lives,” Nico Bouyakhf, the company’s president and managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Asia, said. “Our goal is to deliver the best possible experience with our unique footbed, rather than chasing short-term trends.”\nUltimately, says J’Nae Phillips, a trend forecaster and creator of the Fashion Tingz newsletter, it was precisely this fixation on function that has made Birkenstock a “kind of fashion paradox: a shoe so unconcerned with style that it has become a style statement. Their ‘anti-fashion’ aesthetic taps into a deeper cultural moment where authenticity and utility are often prized over overt trendiness. In a world that cycles rapidly through fast fashion, Birkenstocks offer a stable, grounded alternative.”\nDr Anastasia Kārkliņa Gabriel, a cultural critic and author of Cultural Intelligence for Marketers, points to the brand’s popularity in the 1970s US counterculture as a turning point. “Birkenstock was a rebellion against mainstream American footwear. Once it was adopted by the hippies, it took on a new layer of meanings associated with spiritual freedom and a more conscious way of living.\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\n“When a brand manages to capture our mental real estate and becomes a part of our cultural affinities, it quickly transcends the idea of ‘trends’ that come and go … In a way, the ‘ugliness’ actually becomes part of the brand’s appeal, a way to signal one’s authenticity and refusal to abide by conventional standards of style.”\nOn a rare tour this week of two of its factories in Germany, where all its shoes are assembled from mostly European components, the Guardian was invited to observe a manufacturing process that remains surprisingly hands-on.\nThe cork and latex mix that will become each footbed (the cork granules are ground from the off-cuts of the Portuguese wine cork business) is tamped down by hand before being pressed to shape. Workers scan sheets of coloured leather by eye before carefully placing cutters where the hide has no defects. Even the glue that will fix the leather pieces to the sole is wiped on by hand using a tool that looks a bit like a shaving brush.\nThe shoes are trimmed, stamped, shaped, buckled and boxed by humans (the company boasts that 50 hands make each pair), which makes for shoes that are pleasingly artisanal – and expensive. Having set the model for the lazy summer sandal, the brand is dogged by fake and copycat products, and failed earlier this year in a legal attempt to copyright its products as works of art.\nDon’t bet on that German court case holding Birkenstock back. The company now has a luxury line, called 1774, and a professional line aimed at workers, and continues with high-end designer collaborations and non-sandal launches, such as this month’s Utti Lace shoe. It is also expanding into China and India, has introduced a skincare line, and on Thursday revealed plans to buy another German factory to boost production. The future, be in no doubt, is comfy."

    "body": "Moshe Abutbul, a 39-year-old bible teacher in Sderot, the southern Israeli city by the perimeter of Gaza, thinks life is OK, even “good”. Autumn is on its way which means his small home is less stifling. He enjoys his work. His four children are well; so too is his wife, an English teacher. As for Israel’s growing international isolation, he is unbothered.\n“We are a peace-loving country, but we have to defend ourselves,” he says of Israel’s offensive in Gaza which has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians and devastated swaths of the territory. “Is Israel isolated? I don’t know. Life goes on. It is OK. Life is good,” says Abutbul.\nSderot, scruffy, poor and rightwing, is not a city given to worrying about the bitter condemnation of Israel overseas.\n“If they lived here, they would have a different view. Every day we worry about rockets or a raid,” says Eli Lior, who works in a service station. David, 24, a recent immigrant from Russia, says international criticism was a constant in Israel’s history and so “like water off a duck’s back”.\nOn Friday, Benjamin Netanyahu made an angry and defiant speech at the UN in New York, calling the recognition of a Palestinian state earlier this week by the UK, France, Canada, Portugal and Australia “sheer madness” and a reward for terrorism.\nHe was addressing a hall that was largely empty, after dozens of delegates walked out, but Israeli commentators said that the speech was aimed at the only two audiences that matter to Netanyahu: his political base in Israel and the US president, Donald Trump.\nFor many Israelis, Netanyahu’s warning earlier this month that Israelis had “no choice” but to get used to growing isolation “at least for the coming years”, merely confirmed what they already suspected.\nA poll last month found a majority fear they cannot now to travel abroad due to security threats and mounting global criticism of their country. Last week their government warned violence against Israelis abroad could be prompted by the anniversary of the 2023 attack into Israel by Hamas in which 1,200 died, mostly civilians, including 53 in Sderot.\nThen there are international calls for sports and cultural boycotting of Israel. Concerts in Europe involving Israeli musicians have been cancelled, more than 400 artists have joined a campaign to pull their music from streaming platforms in Israel, and Israel is now facing potential suspension from next year’s Eurovision song contest, to be held in Vienna.\nThe EU, Israel’s biggest trading partner, is considering sanctions, while Israeli participation in the bloc’s Horizon research and innovation programme has already declined steeply, as Europeans have avoided joint projects with Israeli institutions.\nShira Efron, senior fellow at the Rand corporation, says: “We have seen in the past year the erosion of Israel’s legitimacy globally but without formal sanctions, a kind of quiet embargo ... Something such as Eurovision might seem trivial but it isn’t for Israelis.”\nHowever, it is very unclear whether such measures will influence the current government in Israel – the most right-wing in its history – or sway many Jewish Israelis. Many analysts believe Netanyahu and his allies could instead be reinforced.\nGideon Rahat, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says: “There are many people in Israel who are worried about international isolation, but most are not Netanyahu supporters and especially not his base.”\nElections in Israel must be held before November 2026, with some pointing to the coming spring as most likely. Netanyahu’s current coalition and longstanding electoral base encompasses the mainstream but increasingly rightwing and populist Likud party, which he leads, religious parties representing Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, and groups from the hardline nationalist religious Zionist movement, which has surged in recent years.\n“For the ultra-orthodox, the outside world starts at the border of their communities, and the nationalist religious Zionists don’t care … and there are the others who will support Netanyahu whatever … Together, that makes up 30 to 40% [of the electorate],” says Rahat.\nMany Jewish Israelis attribute deteriorating ties with Europe to historic antisemitism, while Netanyahu, who is facing war-crimes charges at the international criminal court, has blamed European Muslim communities and claimed the country has been targeted by clandestine social media campaigns steered by “anti-Israel actors”.\nEfron says isolation often affects mostly those who already disapprove of government policies, such as academics or businesspeople.\n“In the short term, it consolidates the base … and there is no political cost to Israeli politicians taking on Macron or Starmer or European politicians,” she says.\nThousands of international actors, directors and other film industry professionals have pledged not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide … against the Palestinian people”, though others have signed an open letter arguing that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are “often the loudest critics of government policy”.\n“It is something that has existed for two years but with the sanctions rolling in, we will be seeing a lot more of it,” says Addam Yekutieli, a 39-year-old artist in Tel Aviv, whose own work has opposed the Israeli offensive in Gaza and the almost 50-year military occupation of the West Bank.\n“Because my views are quite well known, I feel that I’ve somewhat been spared the backlash. But I think it triggers defence mechanisms here for many people, more than getting them to ask difficult questions … There is an expectation that all this, this war, this genocide, will end and things will go back to normal,” Yekutieli says.\nPolls underline Israel’s deep division. One last week showed that 59% of Israelis were concerned by Israel being barred from cultural and sporting events, but with much higher levels among opposition voters. About half believed Israel should stop the fighting in Gaza and prioritise the release of hostages.\nSome Israeli and Palestinian analysts point to the historical example of the apartheid regime in South Africa, which collapsed after being hit by a wave of international sanctions, despite US support.\nThe parallel is a controversial one, because Israel is frequently accused by human rights organisation and others of implementing an apartheid system with its treatment of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and, by some, within Israel itself.\nItamar Eichner, a well-known commentator, argued last week that the white South African leaders’ decision to dismantle the apartheid regime in the early 1990s was not the result of international pressure but of a recognition that “real and lasting solutions” were needed.\n“Israel now faces a similar crossroads,” Eichner wrote in one of Israel’s largest newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth.\nSanctions comparable to those placed on South Africa are still far off however, and despite its pariah status, South Africa’s apartheid regime survived for decades. The relative resilience of the Israeli economy, boosted by huge government spending of borrowed money, has surprised observers.\nYossi Mekelberg, of London’s Chatham House thinktank, says: “Yes, Israelis are psychologically still on 7 October [2023] and in trauma, Palestinians are in the terrible catastrophe that they are facing. But Israelis also need to understand the tide has changed.”"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/27/fans-followed-me-home-to-the-airport-how-nba-players-cope-with-fame",
    "body": "Michael Cooper knew pressure. The NBA’s 1987 Defensive Player of the Year had won five rings with the 1980s Showtime Lakers, blocking shots alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and finishing “Coop-a-loop” passes from Magic Johnson for dunks. But in 2000, things were different. He wasn’t in the game, he was coaching it from the sidelines for the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks. And despite Cooper being named coach of the year, the Sparks fell short in the playoffs to the Houston Comets.\n“When we lost that,” Cooper says, “people said, ‘Coop, you’re supposed to be this great coach. And you can’t get the Sparks over the hump.’” It was hard to swallow. When most people come up short at work, the world doesn’t know about it – or debate it on live television. “With fame comes consequences,” says Cooper. “You have to take the good and the bad.”\nCooper, who was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame last summer, has an interesting relationship with fame. Though he was on the Showtime Lakers, he never quite felt famous in the 1980s. He wasn’t a big-name college player when he came out of the University New Mexico and his rise in the public consciousness was a slow burn. Cooper became the Laker’s premiere sixth man, coming off the bench, sublimating his ego for the sake of wins.\n“I felt famous,” Cooper says. “But I felt famous as a team. The team was very good, and people appreciated that. When I was walking down the street, if people knew basketball, they knew who I was. But they didn’t see me as an individual [star] – it was more the team.”\nOthers on the Lakers, though, got major attention. Particularly Johnson. If LA lost, Magic would take the blame. Cooper was able to avoid the worst criticism because he wasn’t one of the big stars. He remembers the 1981 playoffs when LA lost to the Rockets. Johnson took a bad last shot and the Lakers lost out on a chance to repeat as champions.\n“The media talked about that all summer,” Cooper says. “For me, I had the luxury – I was able to receive credit when I did great things, and I was able to hide when I didn’t do great things.” That was not the case, though, when he was hired by the Sparks. “But all that changes when you become a coach,” he says. “Coaching – you can’t hide.”\nOn the court, Kenny Anderson never hid. Ever since he was at middle school in New York City, people have been writing about the point guard. “Oh my god!” Anderson days. “Thirteen years old! I’ve been getting press, media since I was 13! I grew up in it. I was good with it.” Anderson, who was a star at a young age in the city that loves its floor generals, says he was able to succeed thanks to those who looked out for him. “I had great mentors,” he says.\nAnderson, who was raised by his mother, Joan, says he looked to the family of another New York City prodigy, Kenny Smith, as an example. Smith, who is five years older than Anderson, was also a point guard. An All-American, Smith succeeded in the city’s pressure-packed scene and went on to star at the University of North Carolina and make the NBA. It was Smith’s family, along with several other coaches and local figures, who helped show the future Georgia Tech star and No 2 pick what to do.\n“His family was very important to me,” Anderson says. “I saw how he was growing up, saw how he was raised.”\nWhen Anderson was a teenager, every newspaper in New York wrote about him – from the Times to the Daily News. They chronicled each game, seemingly every pass and shot. They debated where he would go to college and what his pro chances were. Anything and everything they could find to write about was fair game. Somehow, it never became too much pressure for Anderson, who would eventually become an All-Star with the New Jersey Nets. For others – even pros – it’s not that easy.\n“I was a humble kid,” Anderson says. “A humble young man, that’s just how I grew up. I had a great life.”\nStill, no childhood can prepare anyone for what NBA life is like. Not only are your best days lauded but your mistakes are picked over and your salary is discussed on television. “That was crazy,” Anderson says. “The salary and all the things that happen with your money. That was difficult at times. I didn’t know they were able to do that. Woah! But it is what it is. I was easygoing. I moved on.”\nSalary is one thing – but what if fans start to follow you? For Robert Parish, a four-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer, life as a 7ft 1in basketball star had its ups and downs. People started at him because of his height, even without his fame. How did he handle the scrutiny? “That depends on how aggressive people are,” Parish says. “I still think it’s flattering and it’s a compliment that people recognize me and what I accomplished … [but] sometimes people get a little pushy.”\nParish says even in retirement people will still see him on the street and all but move his longtime partner, Esther, out of the way so they can speak to him. “I don’t like that,” Parish says. During his playing days, Parish says people would trail him around. “People have followed me home, followed me to the game, followed me to the airport. I didn’t feel threatened. I just thought they were taking it too far – it’s not that serious!”\nFor Cooper, who earlier this year led his Miami 305 team to the Big3 championship, one of the beauties of working in sports – beyond the recognition – is that there is almost always another game just around the corner. “There is always a chance to make up for your losses,” Cooper says. “You lose a game one night, you can come back and score 30 and people will forget.”\nHe experienced that up close with the Sparks. After losing in 2000 to the Comets and seeing them with the title again, Cooper heard the complaints from fans. Despite his Showtime Laker pedigree, he didn’t get his team to the promised land, even with one of basketball’s all-time greats, Lisa Leslie, on the Sparks. Cooper took the criticism to heart, but he didn’t ever let it break him.\n“It made me a better coach the following season,” Cooper explains. “I got back to the drawing board. The next year, we were able to break the stranglehold Houston had.” Indeed, in 2001, the Sparks won their first WNBA title. Cooper and company could celebrate at last. “People said, ‘Wow, I guess you can coach! I guess you do know what you’re doing’” Cooper says, with his trademark chortle. (The Sparks won their second title the following season.)\nBut few in pro hoops have won as many games as Cooper in their careers. Anderson, whose 90s New Jersey Nets team didn’t always rise to the level of expectations set for them, knows that. “I got negative attention,” he says. “It was all based on what I said and what I did. It was fair – hey, that’s just how the ball bounces. I understood that because I was a public figure I had to watch what I said and did. If I didn’t, it was coming back [on me].”\nNot everyone, Anderson notes, is able to handle that kind of weight.\n“I was built different,” he says. “I was able to overcome that because of the growth [from] the people that raised me.”"

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/27/afl-grand-final-norm-smith-medal-winner-will-ashcroft-brisbane-lions",
    "body": "Having engineered the Lions’ dominant second half performance in the grand final, Brisbane midfielder Will Ashcroft cemented his meteoric rise to the summit of the AFL by securing a second successive Norm Smith medal.\nThe 21-year-old with the flowing blond mane became just the third player after Andrew McLeod and Dustin Martin to have won the grand final’s best player in consecutive years. With just 58 games to his name, few would dare put a ceiling on what the Lions’ father-son pick might achieve with another decade in the game.\nHis contribution on Saturday was marked by dominance around the contest, as well as a spark in major moments. No other Lion accumulated more than his 32 disposals, and he led the game in clearances with 10. Three goal involvements reflected his calm usage going inside 50, and his fourth-quarter goal effectively ended the contest, putting the margin out behind five majors.\nAshcroft admitted he was surprised to win the medal last year, and having his brother Levi alongside him this time around made the accolade even more special. “For me individually last year, I was probably a bit more shocked when I was announced as the Norm [Smith winner] and won the premiership last year, just because of where I was halfway through the year,” he said.\n“I was coming back from my ACL, just trying to find my feet, I think I played nine games potentially in the home and away season and was just sort of grateful to be playing finals really. Then to have that moment was amazing.\n“But then to, this year, build [on that] and then have Levi at the club all the way through was probably a bit more emotional for the family and a pretty amazing feeling to have him here.”\nLions coach Chris Fagan praised his young midfielder, and joked he might have had a third if he had played in the 2023 decider. “He’s had a very, very positive impact, he’s a real professional, he loves the big games,” he said. “Not just a skilful player, but he’s a tough player as well and he’s still young.”\nThe repeat by Ashcroft was remarkable, but he was not a sure thing for the award as the players gathered around the stage after the siren. Co-captain Harris Andrews was imperious in defence, and Ashcroft’s colleagues in midfield helped roll through the Cats in an unforgettable second half. Hugh McCluggage finished with 26 disposals along with four goals, Jaspa Fletcher was effective with the ball, accruing 29 touches, and Dayne Zorko was was reliable and incisive as ever.\nBut Ashcroft was named winner having earned the maximum three points from three of the judges, and two from the other two. Andrews was second, Zac Bailey – who finished with three goals and an unlikely six behinds – was third, Fletcher was fourth and Zorko fifth.\nSmall forward Charlie Cameron was unfortunate not to be recognised. His two goals in the third quarter were the first of the avalanche that by the end totalled 13 in one half.\nSign up to Australia Sport\nGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk\nafter newsletter promotion\nAndrews praised the 31-year-old Cameron after the game. “His pressure, his ability to get the ball forward and hunt is incredible,” he told Channel Seven. “He went through it a bit this year, the way critics were after him, but Fages [Fagan] and the playing group wrapped our arms around him and reminded him how good he is. On the biggest of days he comes to the fore.”\nBut history will remember Ashcroft’s contribution most of all. He celebrated with his younger brother Levi and Lachie Neale at the siren, an image representing the passing of the torch for Brisbane.\nThe younger Ashcroft was also influential, having bagged a vital goal himself just before half-time. And they were well supported by Neale, who was effective after he was introduced at half-time, gathering 17 disposals and seven clearances.\nThe maroons’ surge while Neale was on the field was no coincidence, and the 32-year-old’s third quarter goal closely followed Cameron’s, sending the Lions on their way to back-to-back flags."

    "body": "More than 1.6 million people have signed a petition opposing the introduction of digital ID cards after Keir Starmer announced plans to make them mandatory for people working in the UK by 2029.\nThe petition says “no one should be forced to register with a state-controlled ID system”, which it describes as a “step towards mass surveillance and digital control”.\nPetitions that receive more than 100,000 signatures are considered for a debate in parliament, but there is little evidence of their success in shaping government policy. More than 6 million people signed one calling for Brexit to be reversed.\nDigital ID cards presented “an enormous opportunity” for the UK, Starmer said on Friday, as the government grappled with a civil liberties row over the proposals.\n“I know working people are worried about the level of illegal migration into this country,” the prime minister said. “A secure border and controlled migration are reasonable demands, and this government is listening and delivering.\n“Digital ID is an enormous opportunity for the UK. It will make it tougher to work illegally in this country, making our borders more secure.”\nHe argued that the “Brit card” would offer ordinary citizens “countless benefits, like being able to prove your identity to access key services swiftly – rather than hunting around for an old utility bill”.\nCivil liberties groups have raised concerns over the proposals, with Silkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, warning the system would “make Britain less free” and create “a domestic mass surveillance infrastructure that will likely sprawl from citizenship to benefits, tax, health, possibly even internet data and more”.\nShe added: “Incredibly sensitive information about each and every one of us would be hoarded by the state and vulnerable to cyber-attacks.”\nAddressing concerns over the government’s use of digital IDs, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said ministers had “no intention of pursuing a dystopian mess”.\nThe Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said her party would oppose any push by the government “to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens”.\nThe Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, also criticised the scheme, which he described as “an anti-British card”.\nWriting in the Daily Express, he said: “The Labour government’s plan to impose digital ID cards on all adults will do nothing to combat illegal immigration. But it will give the state more power to control the British people.”"

    "body": "Butter is no longer just salted or unsalted: British shoppers are increasingly buying flavours such as chocolate and truffle, driven by social media trends and a growing appetite for convenience in home cooking.\nFigures from Worldpanel, an analyst that tracks supermarket sales, show spending on flavoured butters across Britain rose by 24% in the 52 weeks to 7 September 2025, compared with the previous year. In the same period, growth for packs of flavoured butter is also up 16.2%.\nOcado, the UK’s largest online-only supermarket, reports searches for flavoured butter have risen 184% in the past year, suggesting a threefold increase in shopper interest. Sales of M&S’s smoky cowboy butter – infused with spicy flavours such as chipotle – sold via Ocado, have climbed by 136% since launch earlier this year.\nExperts put the rise down to young people who want to experiment and add flavour to their meals. TikTok videos featuring flavoured butter recipes have also helped encourage the trend, attracting hundreds of thousands of views, and popularising new spreads, they say.\nAlice Pilkington, food and drink principal analyst at the market research firm Mintel, said: “There are several factors driving the popularity of flavoured butter, including the emergence of a ‘foodie’ culture and social media’s increasing influence. In the UK, 61% of 16- to 34-year-olds would describe themselves as foodies, compared with 42% of consumers overall.\n“These younger consumers are often discovering new flavours and food trends through social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This has led to a strong appetite for culinary exploration and innovative products.”\nShe added: “Positioning butter as an ingredient to create better home-cooked meals is nothing new: Lurpak has explored this theme for years. However, All Things Butter, launched in the UK in 2023, takes this one step further. The brand started as a series of social media videos during Covid-19, showing founder and chef Thomas Straker making flavoured butters. The butters were then just eaten on bread or added to pasta. This positions butter as the central vehicle of flavour.”\nLurpak’s garlic butter, produced by RLA Foods, remains the market leader with sales worth £5.6m. It continues to expand, with value sales up 18.5% and volumes up 12.2% in the past year. While Christmas has traditionally been the peak season, the brand has also recorded spikes around Easter and at the start of the summer barbecue season, they said.\nAll Things Butter, a fast-growing newcomer to the category, is on track to triple its £1.5m turnover from last year, having launched a series of new products. Its Cinnamon Bun butter, introduced in May 2024, has posted quarterly growth of 245% on average, with sales in January 2025 more than doubling month on month. Between June 2024 and January 2025, volumes rose more than eightfold. The company – that already has garlic and unsalted options – has since launched the UK’s first chocolate butter and a truffle variety.\nRetail buyers say the appeal lies in the ability to enhance simple dishes without adding complexity. “We’ve seen a recent boom in demand for flavoured butters as they’ve become a popular and easy way to elevate everyday meals,” said Harriet Northover, butter and spreads buyer at Ocado.\nDespite economic pressures, consumers are still seeking “affordable luxuries,” says Pilkington, with flavoured butters offering a way to elevate everyday meals at low cost. She added that younger, time-pressed home cooks are particularly drawn to them as a quick route to bold flavour, while brands position the products as both convenient and inventive."

    "body": "The Moldovan diaspora will hold a critical role in Sunday’s high-stakes parliamentary elections as the country battles against an unprecedented Russian vote-buying operation to try to unseat the incumbent pro-European party, said the former deputy prime minister.\nCivilian foreign interference watchdogs say Russia is flooding the overseas voter communities with cash, including one advertising campaign offering people €500 to be election observers in the EU with the lure of “bonuses of up to €30,000” for evidence of voter fraud.\n“They are basically incentivising people to report any type of violation in exchange for money. We think that it might be a preparation to say the election was rigged,” Victoria Olari, a researcher at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab in Chișinǎu, said.\nMoldova is considered highly vulnerable to any Russian expansion, bordering Ukraine and with a diverse population including pro-Russian voters.\n“It is a huge operation, it is something that has not happened in any other country. They are spending crazy money,” said Valeriu Pașa, a senior analyst and founder of WatchDog, another civil society monitor.\nEarlier this week the president, Maia Sandu, warned that the independence of Moldova, a country of just 2.7 million people, was in danger after police arrested dozens of people accused of being in a Russia-backed plot to cause violence on the streets.\nShe has called it the “most consequential” election in the small country’s history, as it teeters between its powerful neighbour Russia and the EU, to which it is an accession candidate.\nElection experts say diaspora voters are being targeted because they played a fundamental role in last November’s presidential elections, responsible for as much as 19% of the ballot.\nNicu Popescu, a candidate for the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) and former deputy prime minister under Sandu, said disinformation was only part of the battle. Buying votes, he said, was “cheaper than missiles”.\n“The digital part, the disinformation, is about a third of their operation, but the biggest chunk of it is cash, either cryptocurrency or bank transfers. It is a massive, brutal, direct vote-buying scheme targeting online manipulators, party activists, journalists and influencers.\n“It is also clear that the EU diaspora has always been voting pro-EU, so the Russians have been trying to also derail that,” he said. However, he cautioned that the Russian goal was not to swing pro-European voters but to ensure “hesitant pro-Russian voters turn out”.\nSign up to Headlines Europe\nA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day\nafter newsletter promotion\nFears of interference on Sunday were further fuelled on Friday after Serbian police arrested two people accused of running “combat tactical training” for dozens of protesters before Sunday’s ballot.\nSandu won a second term in office last November after tense elections with 30 to 40 fake bomb alerts across overseas polling stations.\n“The diaspora will be crucial, because they are one of the highest proportions of voters in democratic elections across the world. This diaspora has always voted in a strongly pro-European manner, so it will be fundamental to the outcome,” said Popescu.\nOlari said the aim of the Russians was not necessarily to get pro-Russian parties elected but to shift support away from pro-European parties and sow seeds of doubt.\n“We saw that in Romania over two election cycles they went from pro-industrial west and pro-European to a situation where more are supporting the far right and pro-Russian groups,” she said.\nPașa, who has also identified attempts to buy election observers overseas, said he did not think the “independent observers” would be “trapped” into committing fraud themselves, but they were being asked to take videos and report back every two hours.\n“I think the Russians really believe that they can find frauds, that they can find substantial differences between the numbers reported by the [Moldovan] Central Electoral Commission and by their observers. They do not believe in democracy. They cannot trust that hundreds of thousands of people will spend hours waiting to vote or travel hundreds of kilometres to take part in a democratic process.”"

    "body": "Fears are growing that shared houses may become the focus of anti-migrant protests, with residents and charities saying tensions are building in some areas.\nHomes of multiple occupation (HMOs) have grown in number as renters seek affordable accommodation amid a housing crisis.\nDefined as a property where three or more tenants live with shared facilities, HMOs are most often used to house students, young professionals, asylum seekers or, increasingly, anyone on a tight budget.\nMessages have been posted on social media urging action against HMOs thought to be housing asylum seekers, with some individuals trying to compile lists of addresses.\nA former pub on the edge of Warrington in Cheshire was daubed with graffiti last month saying “No HMOs” after rumours it was due to be converted. The local council said it had not received any planning application.\nReform UK politicians, including George Finch, the teenage leader of Warwickshire county council, have criticised the use of HMOs to house asylum seekers.\nProtests led by the far right over the summer have been blamed in part on inaccurate and inflammatory claims from politicians including Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform, and Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary.\nThe Home Office has promised to close dozens of asylum hotels in the new year with ministers due to unveil plans to move asylum seekers into military barracks instead.\nBut there has been growing speculation about whether they could, or should, resort to a greater use of HMOs which – separately from the asylum debate – have been blamed for tensions in some communities.\nLouise Calvey of Asylum Matters, which campaigns for better asylum conditions in the UK, said the charity had received reports of an increase in hate crimes near HMOs as well as rumours circulating in communities that HMOs were housing migrants, even if they were not.\n“This anger around HMOs, this fearmongering around HMOs, risks hate crime against all racialised people,” she said. “There’s huge risk. At least if people are in hotels, there’s security there and there’s usually some form of support. In HMOs, it’s much more likely that people are going to be attacked walking around the street and it’s much more likely that those attacks will go unreported.”\nHowever, she stressed that the use of HMOs to house asylum seekers was not new and was unlikely to substantially increase.\nSign up to Headlines UK\nGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\n“The use of HMOs for asylum accommodation has been employed for far longer than hotels,” she said. “But I highly doubt the government is going to be able to close hotels and set up HMOs. There just isn’t access to that housing stock out there.”\nCalvey urged the government to tackle the asylum claims backlog and allow asylum seekers to work, rent rooms or live with family. “The solution is to get people out of both hotels and HMOs where they’re at risk of violence,” she said.\nThe Office for National Statistics estimates there were 182,554 HMOs in England and Wales in April, although some councils believe this figure may be too low.\nLocal authorities have taken steps to try to clamp down on the rise of HMOs in their areas, with councillors in Warrington and Bolton voting to scrap exemptions that meant homes could be converted into small HMOs (with six tenants or fewer) without planning permission.\nLast week, Phil Brickell, the Labour MP for Bolton West, urged the government to allow a debate on why companies such as Serco, which leases hundreds of HMOs across the country, do not tell local communities when and where they are placing asylum seekers.\nHe said the lack of transparency meant proposals for HMOs ended up on social media and surrounded by misinformation."

    "body": "Stuart had no idea the house next door to his had been converted from a three-bedroom family home to a six-bedroom house in multiple occupation (HMO) until he spotted workers installing locks on the living room door.\nAfter contacting the council, Stuart (who did not want to give his last name) and his wife quickly realised there was nothing they could to object to the change, despite sharing an adjoining wall with the property. Six male asylum seekers moved in soon afterwards.\nHe said: “We feel a little bit compromised because we’re very much not against the guys that are in there. I don’t blame anybody for trying to get a better life. I think it’s horrific the way they’ve got to do it.\n“But these are family houses and families should be in them. Even if it was six students from Bolton, it’s still not suitable for individual living quarters. There needs to be a grown-up, mature debate about the whole situation and the government needs to get a grip of it. This isn’t the correct way to do it.”\nIn Horwich, a town on the outskirts of Bolton, frustration over the rise of HMOs has been brewing for some time. The number of HMOs in the north-west city has risen to more than 700 – or 0.56% of housing stock – eight times higher than the national average, according to Bolton council.\nLast year a group of local residents formed a “Say no to HMOs” campaign group, which successfully lobbied Bolton council to introduce tighter restrictions. This meant properties converted to small HMOs with six or fewer tenants, like the one next door to Stuart, would no longer be exempt from the planning application process.\nStuart said a family had been living next door but had been evicted, before it was sold for about £150,000 – cheaper than the average house price on the street – and converted into a HMO with three extra bedrooms. An estate agent told him his own property would now be worth £30,000-£40,000 less due to having an adjoining HMO, he said.\nFurther down the street two other properties have also been converted, ready to be turned into HMOs.\nA couple of doors away, Reg Parkinson said that after some initial noise issues, he had no problem with the HMO currently housing asylum seekers but he worried about the impact of HMOs on the local housing market.\nHe said: “Landlords know they can get more income with a HMO, so they get rid of local families and bring people in. It pushes rent prices up but house values down.”\nPaul Williamson, a retired street cleaner, was visiting from another part of Bolton, where he said there were similar concerns around HMOs housing asylum seekers.\nHe said: “They’ve got to go somewhere, haven’t they? They’re in a position where they can’t do anything else. So what other options have they got? But there are issues. The people next to us won’t speak to us, they don’t want to mix.”\nOne resident around the corner, who asked not be named, said she was worried about the rise of HMOs and their occupants in the area, saying people had felt “scared, ignored and alienated” by the process.\nBut she was more worried about the potential for the street to be targeted by far-right protesters. “There is a concern that somebody will discover that we do have asylum seekers living here, and some idiot who’s exceedingly racist will come and put a brick through the window,” she said.\n“I think there will be more pushback with HMOs than there were with the hotels, because if you put these HMOs in the community unannounced, people are going to be like, what? Hang on. They’ve gone from the hotels to next door to me.”\nStuart agreed that the looming threat of potential far-right protests was a concern. He said: “I’ve seen people online saying, we’ve sorted out the hotels, now we need to target the HMOs. Some have even said, ‘let’s get some addresses’.\n“There’s a danger to us all then.”"

    "body": "Brisbane took the long way home. But they learned their lessons, switched up their modes and turned the tables on Geelong, winning their second premiership in a row and the fifth this century. The Lions won it with their audacious kicks, their clean hands and their cool heads. They had the superior talent, they had the fresher legs and they had their back-to-back flags. In the end, it was a rout.\nMore than anything, they had Harris Andrews, who controlled the air, towelled up Shannon Neale and sagged off to instigate full-ground transitions. In terms of structure, leadership and his risk-reward radar, he was arguably the most important person on the ground, while Neale had an absolute stinker. When the Cats were peppering the goals early in the second half, Andrews outworked the Geelong key forward time and time again.\nAndrews’ ownership of the air allowed his smaller defenders to get to work. As always, you take the good with the bad with Dayne Zorko. Some of his kicks were atrocious. But he wasn’t fazed by any mistakes. He continued to go for the risky, diagonal kicks and the way he eyed off the corridor and pinpointed his man was crucial in slicing open the Cats. Riding shotgun was Jaspa Fletcher, who doesn’t do the showy stuff but who executed with Swiss precision.\nThe depth, the quality and the variety of their midfield was what separated this game. They were relentless when the ball was in dispute and surgical with the way they moved it once they flicked it to the outside. In particular, Will Ashcroft was so clean, so assured and so deadly around stoppages. The way he’d gird his torso and explode from congestion broke the game open repeatedly. His kicking was sublime, personified by his carefully-thought-through topspinner that set up Hugh McCluggage in the second quarter. At just 21, he’s now been among their best handful of players in at least half a dozen finals. He has two Norm Smith medals to his name. If Ashcroft had been there in 2023, the Lions may well have a three-peat.\nAnd then there was Charlie Cameron, who has had a lean trot of late but who stepped up when he was needed most. His first goal was a preposterous snap from right in front of the travelling troupe of Lions fans. Suddenly he had his confidence back and he was whirring across half-forward. And with scores level during time-on in the third term, he bobbed up again with a strong contested mark. A few minutes later he was lurking out the back for his third and John Denver was blaring again.\nIn the first 15 seconds of play in the final term, Cameron slid into space and slotted his fourth. From that point on, this flag was Brisbane’s, and Charlie was a Lions immortal. He had plenty of help from Zac Bailey, another hybrid who capped off an excellent finals series with nine goals across four matches. The Cats were unable to combat his athleticism, his ball use and his nous. Tardy early but deadly all day, he could easily have finished with six or seven goals.\nThen there was Lachie Neale, who was no hope to play a fortnight ago. But he ticked every box, dotted every i, came on after half-time and proved pivotal with his work in close. He didn’t cover a lot of ground but worked in a phone-box, dishing out handballs and getting his runners out into open space. His ability to outwork, outthink and lose his Geelong opponents in heavy traffic helped Brisbane win the stoppage battle.\nSign up to Australia Sport\nGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk\nafter newsletter promotion\nAnd they won it with their young forwards, all of whom offered something different, brought the vim and the flexibility that Geelong couldn’t match. Logan Morris, Kai Lohmann and Ty Gallop kept bobbing up whenever the game called for an intervention.\nIf Geelong thought they could replicate the way they beat them in the qualifying final, they were sadly mistaken. The Cats brought insane pressure that night, and denied the Lions their preferred game. But they had a lot of players who didn’t meet the occasion today. And after a tense first half, it was on the Lions’ terms thereafter. Brisbane still went for their risky kicks, but this time Geelong were unable to lay a glove on them. The Lions ran out the most worthy of premiers, establishing beyond doubt that they are the pre-eminent team of this decade."
